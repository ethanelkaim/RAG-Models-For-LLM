            "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The head of Blackwater USA on Sunday rejected a mounting series of reports suggesting the private contractor's security guards opened fire on innocent Iraqi civilians last month. Blackwater CEO Erik Prince said Sunday that guards \"definitely\" faced insurgent fire September 16. \"There was definitely incoming small arms fire from insurgents\" in the September 16 incident in Baghdad, founder and CEO Erik Prince told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"Late Edition.\" There was no \"deliberate violence,\" committed by Blackwater employees, he added. Still, when asked whether it is possible someone with Blackwater \"screwed up\" in the incident, Prince replied, \"Certainly it's possible.\" He said he expects the FBI investigation to provide many answers. Meanwhile, U.S. and Iraqi officials continue discussing Baghdad's demand that Blackwater be expelled from Iraq within six months, The Associated Press reported Sunday. American officials are also coming up with ways to fill the security gap if Blackwater is forced to leave, AP reported. Blackwater guards, protecting U.S. officials in Iraq, face dangerous circumstances every day and have navigated the vast majority of those situations without any violence, Prince told CNN. The guards just try to do their jobs, and are \"not trying to make any trouble,\" he said. The Iraqi government accuses Blackwater guards of opening fire without provocation on civilians in a crowded area in Baghdad on September 16, killing 17 and wounding 27. Survivors told FBI investigators Blackwater guards shot at civilians presenting no threat.  Watch a Blackwater witness describe his account » . The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene after the incident told military investigators they found no evidence contractors were fired upon, a source familiar with a preliminary U.S. military report told CNN. The soldiers found evidence suggesting the guards fired on cars attempting to leave and found weapon casings on the scene matching only those used by U.S. military and contractors, the military source said. But Prince on Sunday told CNN, \"In the incident reports I've seen, at least three of our armored vehicles were hit by small arms fire, incoming, and one of them damaged, which actually delayed their departure from the traffic circle while they tried to rig a tow. \"So there was definitely incoming small-arms fire from insurgents.\" He added, \"I guarantee our guys weren't shooting at each other.\" And he said the traffic circle is very big, so those first soldiers on the scene would have needed \"almost a battalion to secure that entire area, to do a thorough crime scene type investigation.\" \"So the jury is still out. We'll see what the FBI report comes up with, but I'm confident that the kind of people we have out there are proven military professionals,\" Prince said. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh accused Blackwater of \"a deliberate crime against civilians,\" and said the company \"should be tried in court, and the victims should be compensated.\" A Philadelphia law firm has filed suit in federal court against Blackwater on behalf of the families of three Iraqis killed and one wounded in the in the incident, which occurred in and around Baghdad's Nusoor Square. The suit claims Blackwater \"created and fostered a culture of lawlessness amongst its employees, encouraging them to act in the company's financial interests at the expense of innocent human life.\" Prince called the lawsuit \"politically motivated\" for \"media attention,\" and rejected the depictions of his company. \"In Baghdad, the most dangerous city in the world, to say that it was a callous, rampant, evil action, you know, when the guys get it right 99 out of 100 times and don't have to use any force or any violence at all, I think they are doing very well,\" he said.

The seats of the bus that rolled over are exposed to the snow at the crash site in southeastern Utah on Monday. At least 50 people were on the Arrow Stage Lines bus when it crashed on state Highway 163, about five miles north of Mexican Hat, at 7:30 p.m. (9:30 p.m. ET), said Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Cameron Roden. Troopers reported the road was wet but not icy, he said. The bus was traveling south from Telluride, Colorado, to Phoenix, Arizona, when it left the right side of the highway and rolled over, Roden said.  See where the crash occurred » . Police said the bus lost control on a curve, ran off the road and rolled over several times, tumbling 41 feet down an embankment, according to The Associated Press. \"When the vehicle was overturning, the roof of the bus split open and multiple occupants of the vehicle were ejected,\" Roden told the AP.  Watch how the crash left the bus a mangled hulk » . Rescue crews took the injured people to hospitals in Utah, Colorado and Arizona, he said. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that ambulances from Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico responded to the accident, and a helicopter from Colorado could not fly to the crash site because of winter storms. Four of the dead were male and five were female, the Utah Highway Patrol said. Most of the passengers were returning home from a weekend ski trip to Telluride, he said. E-mail to a friend .

            "(CNN) -- When Brian Burton, a little known DJ operating under the name of Danger Mouse, released \"The Grey Album\" in 2003, he brought to mainstream attention a new form of musical genre made possible by the advance of modern technology and the Internet. He also inadvertently sparked a debate about record labels' monopoly of music ownership. \"The Grey Album\" consists of a series of \"mash-ups,\" songs made by splicing together elements from two or more separate tracks, the vocals from one, the music from others. Burton used the vocal tracks from rapper Jay Z's \"Black Album\" and music from The Beatles' \"White Album\". The album was well received. His decision to bring together the world's biggest hip hop star with the best-selling band of all time probably contributed to its positive reception by the critics. It was described as \"the most creatively captivating\" album of the year by The Boston Globe and voted best album of 2004 by Entertainment Weekly. But its success probably owes just as much to the controversy it caused. While Jay Z had released his \"a capella\" vocal tracks with the intention that they could be used as sampling material, Burton had borrowed the Beatles' music without permission from the copyright holders, EMI Music. EMI moved swiftly to block sales of the album but anti-copyright activists stepped in, and battle lines were drawn. Downhill Battle, a group that campaigns for a fairer music industry, organized an online protest, dubbed \"Grey Tuesday\" in which they offered up the album to download for free on approximately 170 Web sites as a form of deliberate civil disobedience. With over 100,000 downloads, Downhill Battle claims that \"The Grey Album\" was the number one album in the United States on the day. The two groups represented polar opposite points of view. EMI's position was that they earn a livelihood out of the music. By blocking the sale of this album they were simply protecting their investment. Downhill Battle, on the other hand, argued that while copyright holders should get a cut of the proceeds from the sale of music, the licence fees were far too high and too large a proportion goes to the music label and not to individual artists. Moreover, they argued, music was built on a tradition of sharing and much that is good has come from one artist passing the baton to another, who might give a different interpretation, even improve, on an original work. \"The reason we have copyright is to ensure that creators are able to benefit from the things that they do so that they can keep creating,\" says Nicholas Reville, Director at Downhill Battle. \"What's happened to copyright with music recently is that it has been used as a way to restrict creativity, limit art and censor what people are allowed to do. \"What made 'The Grey Album' so significant was that it brought together two of the most popular musical acts from two different eras into a totally new piece of art that was considered by everybody as culturally significant. There's no reason why any society would not want that creation to exist.\" Reville says that Downhill Battle's argument is that copyright should exist but that laws should be reviewed so that bedroom musicians everywhere can have access to sample music without needing a lawyer to guide them through the legal quagmire. The \"mash-up\" is not a new phenomenon. In Indian music there is a tradition of borrowing tunes and melodies and incorporating them into new compositions. Western folk music also encouraged the practice of passing on songs for reinterpretation by new generations. As a musical genre, the \"mash-up's\" origins lie in the birth of hip hop, when DJs such as Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash began using the drum sections form vinyl records as a back-beat for MC's to rap over. The development of the Internet has simply fast-forwarded the culture of borrowing by making it all that much easier -- \"mash-up\" artists have access to so much more music than their forebears. And peer-to-peer and social networking sites mean that \"mash-ups\" have found a distribution system that by-passes the usual gate-keepers - record companies and music stores. \"There are elements of this idea that have been around for a long time,\" says Rupert Evans of yourspins.com. \"Mozart wrote a piano concerto where every time you finished a bar you're meant to roll a dice to see what it was you played next. \"People have always been into the idea of how you can break things down and put them back together and I think it's something that's been highlighted recently due to technology and the hip hop 'vibe' has taken it and tried to twist it around. \"When people first started recording music it meant you were stuck with just one version. There isn't supposed to be a definitive version.\" It would seem that artists are beginning to cotton on. At yourspins.com musicians such as Moby, Robbie Williams, Roots Manuva and Natasha Bedingfield have released their work for remixing by the public. The musicians provide the user with a selection of variations on the different elements of a song -- bass line, drum, vocals, etc. -- which can be put together in any order. The result is \"as many versions of the song as there are atoms in the universe,\" says Evans. There is one large distinction between what Danger Mouse was doing with \"The Grey Album\" and the music produced by remixers on yourspins.com. While \"The Grey Album\" was championed as an original work of art, Evans does not believe that the same can be said of yourspins.com's remixes. \"It's a hard distinction to defend but [Danger Mouse] picked a couple of things himself. There was some creativity in saying: 'I can put this and that together', whereas we are giving people a toolkit,\" says Evans. In yourspins.com's legal framework, the copyright still belongs to the artist who can even sell on the remix if they wish. Evans says that the laws have relaxed since he first set up yourspins.com. \"At the beginning a lawyer was telling me that every time someone wanted to go on my Web site they would have to sign a paper saying that they weren't going to claim copyright over what they had created, and the artist was going to have to sign a paper giving permission every time, which obviously wouldn't have worked,\" he says. Technology is breaking down the barriers between musicians and their audiences, allowing both sides to interact in ways that would have been unimaginable thirty years ago, but the record companies are still holding on stubbornly to their monopoly of the market, and it seems there is still a fair way to go before musical culture becomes truly democratic.

            "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Sean Kingston was talking about his hit song \"Fire Burning\" when his cell phone suddenly started to ring. The device blasted a familiar tune. Sean Kingston has one of the summer's hottest hits with \"Fire Burning.\" She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor. Wait a minute. His own song is his ringtone? \"I've got to support it, man,\" said Kingston, 19, with a cheeky smile. \"It goes right back in my pocket, but hey.\" There had better be plenty of room in those pockets. \"Fire Burning\" is shaping up to be one of the summer's hottest tracks, with more than a million downloads sold, and is the second best-selling song on iTunes this week. For mainstream radio listeners and nightclub goers, the reggae-trance track is inescapable. Even for Kingston.  Watch how Kingston sets the dance floor ablaze » . \"Three days ago I was in an elevator,\" he said. \"A lady came in and she had her iPod and she was playing my song. She didn't know who she was standing next to. That was kind of funny.\" But hearing his music in public doesn't mean he's allowed to get too cocky, he said. \"It actually motivates me to make even more music, because that's kind of big. Coming from where I'm from -- coming from nothing -- it's just amazing to hear people react to my music like they do.\" The Miami-born artist, whose real name is Kisean Anderson -- he changed his name to Kingston to reflect his Jamaican heritage -- got a taste for the big time in 2007 when his debut song \"Beautiful Girls\" became a No. 1 hit in the United States. His sophomore album, called \"Tomorrow,\" comes out September 22. Kingston just wrapped filming in Los Angeles for the music video for its second single, \"Face Drop.\" Kingston dropped by CNN to share his thoughts on his abilities on the dance floor and the leading ladies of pop. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: How much time do you actually spend on the dance floor? Sean Kingston: I spend a lot of time on the dance floor, [though] ... I'm more the type of dude to sit back and pose and act cool. But I had to make a song for it because there's a lot of stuff that's going on in the world today ... people want to dance. People want to let loose and \"Fire Burning\" is a song that you can do that to. CNN: You were born in Miami. You grew up in Kingston. Then you moved to L.A. Where do you feel most at home? Sean Kingston: I feel really at home, I can't even lie, in Miami. Because it's just like I know a lot of people, my friends that are there. That's where I started doing music when I was in Miami. CNN: Why call your sophomore album \"Tomorrow\"? Kingston: Because I feel like it's so futuristic. I felt like my last album was yesterday. Nobody's going to be able to expect what Sean Kingston is bringing on this new album. CNN: The first track that came off the new album was a collaboration with Lil' Wayne. It didn't take off like your previous hits. Why do you think that is? Kingston: We never sent it to radio. That record got leaked. It got leaked from the Internet and we just kept it going. But it never really got that push from the label. But I mean it did good. I mean 4 million plays on YouTube, 3 million on MySpace. Sometimes you've got to give free music to get people to pay attention and to build a buzz. So I basically gave my fans free music. CNN: You collaborate with punk-pop band Good Charlotte on the album. Kingston: Yeah. Benji and Joel [Madden], man! Those guys are hilarious. They're talented and geniuses. ... The whole \"Tomorrow\" album ... it's ridiculous. I feel like it's going to be the album of the year. I feel like it's my best album that I ever made. It's way better than the first one. CNN: Do you feel like you've pioneered this new sound that combines reggae and hip-hop and other elements? Kingston: I definitely think that's my own style. I definitely think I came in the game and I got my own blend. I've got something that I call hip-pop, not hip-hop. And a lot of people are starting to use that now but I feel like it was my fusion. CNN: Is it fair to say that \"Beautiful Girls\" brought massive change to your life? Kingston: It did. It changed my life like that! No other song did it but that song. I'm blessed. CNN: Are you surprised that it only takes one hit song to make someone a huge star? Kingston: It didn't really quite take me one. It took me one to get in the door. And then it took having a Top Five record. But you've got to understand ... in this music business, there are so many one-hit wonders. You could have a hit, but it's like \"OK, could you follow up?\" So it's not about what your past is, it's about longevity. CNN: You've been the opening act for Gwen Stefani and Beyonce. Who are some other female musicians you admire? Kingston: Man, those two are amazing. Gwen Stefani! That's what you call a star right there. Just to be in her presence ... I learned a lot from her. She's just amazing. Beyonce too. I like Mary J. Blige. Rhianna! I met her a lot of times and she's down to earth. She's so cool. And she's an island girl. And I'm an island dude, and we gotta hold down for other people.\n"

            "(Rolling Stone) -- This has been the first rock & roll decade without revolution, or true revolutionaries, to call its own. The Fifties witnessed nothing less than the birth of the music. The Sixties were rocked by Beatlemania, Motown, Phil Spector, psychedelia and Bob Dylan. The Seventies gave rise to David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, heavy metal, punk and New Wave. In comparison, the Eighties have been the decade of, among other things, synth pop, Michael Jackson, the compact disc, Sixties reunion tours, the Beastie Boys and a lot more heavy metal. But if the past ten years haven't exactly been the stuff of revolution, they have been a critical time of re-assessment and reconstruction. Musicians and audiences alike have struggled to come to terms with rock's parameters and possibilities, its emotional resonance and often dormant social consciousness. Rolling Stone's Original 1980 Review . The following survey of the 100 best albums of the Eighties, as selected by the editors of Rolling Stone, shows that the music and the values it stands for have been richer for the struggle. Punks got older and more articulate in their frustration and rage, while many veteran artists responded to that movement's challenge with their most vital work in years. And rap transformed the face -- and voice -- of popular music. The first 10 entries here span the Clash's polyglot punk, Prince's crossover funkadelica, Afro-bop from Talking Heads and Paul Simon and hymns of innocence and experience by U2 and Tracy Chapman. Further down the list, old-timers like Dylan, the Stones and Lou Reed hit new highs; Public Enemy and Run-D.M.C. kicked out some serious streetwise jams; Metallica and Guns n' Roses established new hard-rock beachheads; and Hüsker Dü, Sonic Youth and the Replacements offered definitive statements of postpunk angst. The embarrassment of riches on this list is all the more remarkable, since arthritic radio programming, corporate sponsorship and outbursts of racism and sexism in rap and metal have complicated rock's present and raised fears for its future. Best-of lists such as this one are by nature subjective. But rock in the Eighties was like that -- lively, varied, contentious and, to some degree, inconclusive. Looking at the best rock has had to offer in the Eighties, it's clear that there's plenty of life left in the old beast yet. The next revolution may be just around the corner. See the full list of 100 best albums of the 1980s here. 1. The Clash, \"London Calling\" This album could not have come at a more perfect time or from a more appropriate band than the Clash. Released stateside in January 1980, with the decade but a pup and the new year in gear, \"London Calling\" was an emergency broadcast from rock's Last Angry Band, serving notice that Armageddon was nigh, Western society was rotten at the core, and rock & roll needed a good boot in the rear. 2. Prince and the Revolution, \"Purple Rain\" Released in tandem with the film of the same name, \"Purple Rain\" was more than simply a soundtrack, and it stands as Prince's most cohesive and accessible album. \"He envisioned the film as he made the album,\" says Alan Leeds, vice-president of Paisley Park Records, Prince's label. \"He had a vision in his mind of the film a year before he got in front of the cameras, and he wrote the music to that vision.\" 3. U2, \"The Joshua Tree\" \"The Joshua Tree\" is the rather esoterically titled album he's referring to -- a title that even the typically solemn Bono could joke about. 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: 'London Calling' by the Clash . 4. Talking Heads, \"Remain in Light\" \"Remain in Light\" may have been a commercial disappointment, but musically, the band's 1980 album -- which combines funk, disco and African rhythms -- was years ahead of its time. \"It got great critical acclaim, and we felt that it kind of took popular music to the next phase,\" says Frantz, \"which is what we always wanted to do.\" 5. Paul Simon, \"Graceland\" The journey to \"Graceland\" began with an unlabeled cassette tape that guitarist Heidi Berg gave to Simon, who listened to it incessantly, without knowing what it was, throughout the summer of 1984. 6. Bruce Springsteen, \"Born in the U.S.A.\" \"Born in the U.S.A.\" -- the album, the song and the sixteen-month tour -- turned out to be the breakthrough that Springsteen fans had been expecting for a decade. The influential Jersey musician became the world's biggest rock star -- and a bona fide American icon, to boot. 7. Michael Jackson, \"Thriller\" \"Thriller,\" reportedly recorded for $750,000, has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide -- and it still sells. It earned Jackson over 150 gold and platinum awards worldwide and a record seven Grammys. 8. R.E.M., \"Murmur\" The members of R.E.M. incorporated elements of folk and country music into pop that was, by turns, bright and murky. Theirs was a quasi-traditional yet boundary-breaking sound that served as a blueprint for alternative bands throughout America for the rest of the decade. 9. Richard and Linda Thompson, \"Shoot Out the Lights\" \"Even in the best days of our marriage, Richard and I didn't communicate with each other fabulously well,\" says Linda Thompson. \"I think that the reason the music was good was that we tended to save it for work.\" Perhaps that explains why \"Shoot Out the Lights\" is both the best and last album Richard and Linda Thompson made together. 10. Tracy Chapman, \"Tracy Chapman\" Tracy Chapman was discovered in 1987 by fellow Tufts University student Brian Koppelman. \"I was helping organize a boycott protest against apartheid at school, and someone told me there was this great protest singer I should get to play at the rally,\" says Koppelman, who now works in A&R at Elektra. He went to see Chapman perform at a coffeehouse called Cappuccino. \"Tracy walked onstage, and it was like an epiphany,\" he says. \"Her presence, her voice, her songs, her sincerity -- it all came across.\" See the full list of 100 best albums of the 1980s here.

            "(CNN) -- In 1980, in the pre-Internet, pre-download days when R.E.M. formed in Athens, Georgia, there was no alternative. There was no Americana. There was no grunge. If you listened to pop music, there were essentially three divisions: Top 40 of the type you heard on the rapidly fading AM radio, the corporate rock of album-oriented FM and what was then called college radio -- a catch-all for the punk, new wave, electronic, low-fi and oddball music that almost never crossed over to the mainstream. R.E.M. helped to change all that. They weren't the only ones -- the New York art-punks of the late '70s, notably Talking Heads and Blondie, had hit the Top 40, and fellow Athens scenesters the B-52's had established a national following with their party-down rave-ups. But it was R.E.M. that, in the words of Allmusic.com's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \"transformed the American underground.\" If, in the '60s, teenagers gathered in their parents' garages in the hopes of being the next Beatles, in the '80s young adults knocked around dormitories in hopes of being the next R.E.M.: melodic, guitar-based and determined not to sell out to the corporate-music crowd. R.E.M. was the great hope of fame-fantasizing, used-record-store clerks everywhere. \"They did this grass-roots thing that nobody had ever done,\" said Angie Carlson, a former member of the band Let's Active, which toured with R.E.M. in the mid-'80s. \"They sort of bypassed big marketing, and were at the clubs networking with the cool fellow record-store people.\" In R.E.M.'s wake came a breadth of artists who turned college radio into a home for guitar-based rock and power-pop: the Replacements, Jason and the Scorchers and the Del Fuegos, among many others. Years later, Nirvana emerged and the whole world broke open. Kurt Cobain, in fact, was a big R.E.M. fan. Now R.E.M. has come to an end. \"To our Fans and Friends: As R.E.M., and as lifelong friends and co-conspirators, we have decided to call it a day as a band,\" read a message posted on the group's website Wednesday. \"We walk away with a great sense of gratitude, of finality, and of astonishment at all we have accomplished. To anyone who ever felt touched by our music, our deepest thanks for listening.\" The band didn't easily fit labels. Its early sound, led by Peter Buck's ringing guitar arpeggios, might best be described as folk-rock, equal parts Byrds-ian harmony and punk snarl. Alongside was lead singer Michael Stipe's reedy vocals and, more distinctively, his resonant, nonsensical lyrics, full of phrases such as \"Cages under cage\" and \"Hear the howl of the rope.\" (Pre-Internet, a popular music-geek parlor game involved deciphering R.E.M. lyrics.) And underneath Buck and Stipe was the rock-solid rhythm section of bassist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry, filling spaces with melodic bass lines and powerhouse percussion. R.E.M. may have had its artsy flourishes, but the band also -- in \"American Bandstand\" parlance -- \"had a good beat you could dance to.\" The band formed at a time when \"underground\" really meant something, said Carlson, now of Figure Eight Publicity. \"You couldn't trade (music) on the Internet. You had to know somebody or you had to go the club,\" she said. \"And that's the other reason a band like that was able to thrive -- people went to see live music. \"And they had such a cool vibe in person. They were smart, they were funny, they were charismatic. All of that played into it.\" Moreover, the band worked hard, providing a model for others to follow. In the '80s, starting with the 1982 EP \"Chronic Town,\" there was a new record almost every year, each one followed by a never-ending tour of theaters and clubs. \"Nobody wanted to play the kinds of bars we played,\" Berry recalled in \"Party Out of Bounds,\" Rodger Lyle Brown's chronicle of the Athens music scene. \"Just by being an out-of-town band that played this new kind of music, we were stars.\" They had a personal connection with their fans; after all, Buck was a record-store clerk once, too, and had a deep appreciation of music history. Decades on, they have maintained their ties to Athens. Their management office is still in town. With each album the band's sound grew deeper and wider, developing the basics on \"Murmur\" -- Rolling Stone's 1983 album of the year -- and \"Reckoning,\" exploring folk on \"Fables of the Reconstruction,\" and getting back to their roots in 1986's \"Lifes Rich Pageant.\" R.E.M. finally broke through to mainstream success with 1987's \"Document,\" which contained the band's first Top 10 hit, \"The One I Love,\" as well as the radio favorite \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine).\" \"Document\" changed things, for the band and its audience. With its success came a major-label deal with Warner Bros. and a change in venue from theaters to arenas. \"It's weird being a media figure, to be recognized everywhere by somebody,\" Stipe told Rolling Stone in 1992. The members of R.E.M. always seemed aware of their status and took pains to remain true to their muse. \"That would be my worst fear, that we would turn into one of those dumb bands who go into their second decade and don't know how bad they are and don't know when to give it up,\" Stipe told Rolling Stone. Despite the concerns of many fans -- who, as a 2003 Slate article observed, have been claiming the band's decline since 1984 -- the early-'90s albums included some of R.E.M.'s best work. \"Out of Time\" (1991) featured one of the band's best songs, \"Losing My Religion\"; famed indie DJ Vin Scelsa was so taken with the song that he played it repeatedly during one radio show. Perhaps the best of the run -- and, to some, the band's best album, period -- was 1992's elegiac \"Automatic for the People,\" which hit all the right notes: somber (\"Drive\"), humorous (\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight\"), angry (\"Ignoreland\") and hopeful (\"Everybody Hurts\"). The band even managed to work in the F-word in \"Star Me Kitten,\" their knockoff of 10cc's \"I'm Not in Love.\" But the rest of the '90s proved difficult. With the million-selling albums and gigantic tours, they risked becoming what fans had feared: a corporate behemoth. More dramatically, drummer Berry suffered a life-threatening brain aneurysm while on tour in 1995. He left the group in 1997, becoming a gentleman farmer in Watkinsville, Georgia, south of Athens. The band continued, but it wasn't the same. The albums, such as \"Up\" (1998) and \"Reveal\" (2001), were a mixed bag. \"Not as bad as it first sounds, but also not as good as they thought when they released it,\" critic Robert Christgau said of \"Reveal.\" They toured, on and off. Buck hung out with pal Scott McCaughey's band, the Minus 5. The buzz moved on. Hopes were raised with the band's most recent release, \"Collapse Into Now.\" \"Song for song, the best thing we've ever done,\" Buck told Rolling Stone earlier this year. \"We surprised ourselves with this record. We're all really thrilled with it,\" said Stipe in a June CNN interview. But the album was also the end of something -- the final record in their current Warner Bros. deal. It was time for the circle to close. \"We realized that these songs seemed to draw a natural line under the last 31 years of our working together,\" Stipe told CNN. Perhaps that's enough. \"You can talk to any band. They owe a debt to them, somehow,\" Carlson said. After all, as the band sang in \"Talk About the Passion,\" \"Not everyone can carry the weight of the world.\"\n"

            "(CNN) -- One more time, Whitney Houston brought a crowd to its feet. \"I Will Always Love You\" had earned record of the year at the 1994 Grammy festivities, with the accompanying \"The Bodyguard\" soundtrack taking home best album. But for all the awards that Houston earned that night, it was her voice that resonated most -- as it did throughout her career. The iconic songstress' range and power were on display once again Sunday night, echoing through the packed Staples Center moments after the music world's luminaries bowed their heads in prayer in honor of her death. By the time a replay of her 1994 performance was complete, the audience's applause gave way to an emotional standing ovation. A day earlier, Houston was pronounced dead in her fourth floor room at a Beverly Hills, California, hotel. The world may wait as many as eight weeks -- when results from toxicology and other tests should be in -- to learn what happened, with Assistant Chief Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroner's office saying little Sunday besides \"foul play is not suspected.\" Headlines in recent years about Houston have tended to focus more on her battles with drug addiction and her relationship with her ex-husband, \"New Edition\" performer Bobby Brown, than her musical accomplishments. Yet recollections of her enormous talent took center stage Sunday night in Los Angeles, as did the six-time Grammy winner's membership in the music world's \"family.\" LL Cool J, host of the 54th annual Grammy Awards, spoke right away to Houston's personal and professional legacy, soon after taking the stage following an opening performance by Bruce Springsteen. \"Tonight, we ask ourselves: How do we speak to this time? To this day? There is no way around this. We've had a death in our family,\" he said. The rapper and actor then offered his prayer, thanking God \"for sharing our sister Whitney with us.\" \"And although she's gone too soon, we remain truly blessed to have been touched by her beautiful spirit and to have her lasting legacy of music to cherish and share forever,\" he said. During the show, stars of past and present -- from Bruno Mars to Stevie Wonder -- celebrated the late singer. The sentiments voiced Sunday night echoed those that have been offered ever since news broke of Houston's death from close friends, musical icons and everyday fans who never met the iconic performer but were moved by her music. Then, after a memorial honoring other stars from Amy Winehouse to Clarence Clemons who also died this past year -- and nearly three hours after LL Cool J promised the Grammys \"will remember you the best way we know how: with a song\" -- Jennifer Hudson appeared under a bright, solitary spotlight. Wearing a black sleeveless dress and anchored firmly in the middle of the stage, the Oscar and two-time Grammy winner offered her own rendition of \"I Will Always Love You.\" Twice during the song, the crowd burst into applause. Hudson offered one small embellishment, changing a lyric to sing: \"Whitney, we will always love you.\"\n"

            "(Rolling Stone) -- Hip-hop has never produced anything quite like Drake -- a guy with a Jay-Z ego and a Charlie Brown soul. The Canadian singer-rapper introduced his melancholy-player persona on 2010's platinum \"Thank Me Later,\" spooling out alarmingly mellow confessional brags over synth-streaked tracks that suggested someone had spiked his Cristal with NyQuil and truth serum. \"Famous like a drug that I've taken too much of,\" he rapped, and somehow made you sympathetic to all his stardom-is-hard meditations. So, how's he feeling these days? The cover of \"Take Care\" says it all: Drake sits forlornly in the depths of a mansion he could've bought from 1970s Jimmy Page, slung over a golden goblet of $50-a-glass painkiller. Dude probably had sex two minutes ago, but he looks like his dog just got run over by a garbage truck. The music is grandiose, full of big names and weighty references -- from the drunk-dial epic \"Marvin's Room\" to the N'awlins hip-hop tribute \"Practice\" to cameos from AndrÃ© 3000, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne and Stevie Wonder. Where \"Thank Me Later\" was airy and spare, \"Take Care\" truly goes for it with luxe, expansive production: On \"Cameras,\" beatmaking prodigy Lex Luger provides diamond-bright high-hat clicks, low-end vroom and soulful background vocals as Drake struggles to convince his girl he's not cheating on her after she sees him in a magazine with another woman; on \"Lord Knows,\" Just Blaze laces a shake-the-sky mix of gospel choir, gauzy R&B sample and stomping beat, and Rick Ross swoops in for a hilarious freestyle: \"Villa on the water with the wonderful views/Only fat ni**a in the sauna with Jews.\" There's even a funky thank-you letter to Drake's mom. Drake's 'Take Care': A Track-by-Track Breakdown . Mostly, Drake stretches out over languid, austerely plush tracks that blur hip-hop, R&B and downtempo dance music. \"Over My Dead Body\" opens the album with a dreamweave of cascading pianos and plaintive backing vocals from Canadian singer Chantal Kreviazuk: \"I was drinking at the Palms last night/And ended up losing everything that I came with,\" he raps in his finest just-woke-up voice. It's what Drake does best, collapsing many moods -- arrogance, sadness, tenderness and self-pity -- into one vast, squish-souled emotion. On the elegant title track, Jamie Smith of U.K. band the xx lays down house-music pianos, ice sheets of guitar and a sample from recently deceased R&B radical Gil Scott-Heron as Drake and Rihanna do their laid-back, realist appraisal of the love game: \"When you're ready, just say you're ready,\" he reassures. Is it going to work out? Maybe. But like most hopeless romantics, Drake favors the illusion of infinite promise over the reality anyway. The 30 Best Albums of 2010: Drake, 'Thank Me Later' \"We live in a generation of not being in love,\" he says over Stevie Wonder's harmonica on \"Doing It Wrong.\" It's as close as \"Take Care\" gets to a message for our times. But deep down you wonder if he'd have it any other way. After all, in a fully requited world, who'd need Drake? Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.\n"

            "(CNN) -- Brooklyn noise-pop duo Derek Miller and Alexis Krauss, aka Sleigh Bells, may have just released \"Reign of Terror,\" the follow-up to their critically acclaimed debut, \"Treats,\" but, believe it or not, they have only written one song together so far. \"Comeback Kid,\" the lead single and last song that made it to \"Reign of Terror,\" was their first collaborative effort. As Sleigh Bells' story of origin goes: Miller, a former guitarist for the Florida hardcore band Poison the Well, was writing what would become \"Treats\" while waiting tables in New York. He served Alexis Krauss, a former teen-pop singer, and her mother. Miller mentioned he was looking for a singer for his unfinished demos and Krauss' mom stepped in to broker the deal. Miller and Krauss recorded \"Treats\" and, within a year, they went from strangers to the pair behind one of the best albums of 2010. At the same time the group was taking off, Miller was struggling with both the sudden death of his father in a motorcycle crash and his mother being diagnosed with cancer. He wrote everything but \"Comeback Kid\" during this dark period. \"'Reign of Terror' isn't a clever title,\" he has said. \"That's what I felt like I was going through the last two years.\" Now, things are looking up. Miller's mother is doing well, the album has scored top reviews, Sleigh Bells performed on \"Saturday Night Live\" and Miller is already working on new material. For their third album, he says, Krauss' influence will be much more obvious. In the meantime, the band is opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on tour and they have announced more summer shows. CNN: How did coming up through the Florida hardcore scene affect what we hear in Sleigh Bells today? Derek Miller: That's the music that was happening in my backyard and it was a great outlet for all of the directionless anger and aggression that young men have when you hit puberty. Just angry at the world for no g--d--- reason. Hardcore was perfect for me. Up until that point, I was as determined to become a professional surfer, but after I got a guitar, it took over my entire life. I just never left my room. And it hasn't really changed since. I mean, I've since become a producer and gotten into beat making, but that was it. That was the shift. CNN: Since you hadn't worked with Alexis before \"Treats,\" was there a particular a-ha moment when you knew there was something to your collaboration? Miller: I could hear it. I'm not saying that I knew the music was really good, I'm just saying that I knew it deserved to exist. I didn't how it would be received, but I knew that, at the very least, I had broken through that wall of mediocrity that I had been smashing myself against for so long. I knew it. I was like, oh my God, finally. This is what I've been waiting for. I can't tell you how excited I was. It came at a very dark time and I just completely made it my life. The whole thing seemed so improbable. I had been waiting tables for four years. I was the waiter who was going to make records and I'd tell anyone and everyone. And they were like, yeah, yeah, that's nice. An old Poison the Well fan came in to the restaurant and recognized me. He had a Poison the Well tattoo and I showed my manager; I was like, look, this is my old band! See? And he'd be like, that's very nice Mr. Miller, but can you please bus table 22? CNN: It seems like from the moment you two hooked up, success with Sleigh Bells came very quickly. Did it feel that way for you as well? Miller: I'm comfortable with the perception that it happened very quickly, even though I know how hard I worked on it for so many years and how much growing I had to do, how many horrible mediocre songs I wrote and threw away. But nobody needs to hear about that. From the outside looking in, it looks like it happened very quickly. I think the reason we've been able to really sustain it and turn it into something other than a flash in the pan is because there's a lot of work and a lot of serious focus. I was working very hard for it for a long time and failing. CNN: What did you learn from the success of \"Treats\" that you brought into \"Reign of Terror\"? Miller: Creatively, it was as simple as having a guitar in my hands every night. That is a boring answer, but before we went on tour for \"Treats,\" I hadn't been on tour since I was 22 and I got into production. All I was thinking about was rhythm and I was making a lot of beats, then suddenly I'm on tour for 15 months playing guitar on stage every night. It was just by proximity that I just started writing on guitar again. CNN: What were some of your influences? Miller: Lyrically, I worked through a lot of the stuff that was f--king my head up on \"Reign of Terror\" and it helped me grow. This is borderline corny, but it was really therapeutic. It was like one long therapy session for me, just sort of working out some things. \"Hysteria,\" the Def Leppard record, had a really strong grip on me. I love the songs, but especially the production as well. What Mutt Lange put on that record, I was obsessed with. But I'm moving away from those influences. I've been working on a ton of new stuff and branching out so it's an exciting time. I'm in a much better headspace and I think that that's reflected in the new stuff, which obviously won't be out for a little while, but the spark is there. CNN: What direction will the new material be taking? Miller: I'm going to be collaborating a lot more with Alexis this time around. We got a lot closer on \"Reign of Terror,\" but really the last song we worked on was \"Comeback Kid.\" I sort of just gave her the instrumental. I had the lyric and half an idea for a melody, but that's our first true collaboration and it's my favorite song on the record. I think really we have not utilized any of her talents. She is incredibly gifted when it comes to coming up with really memorable melodies, what I consider to be great melodies. There's so much of her in \"Comeback Kid\" and I love it. I happen to play in a band with her, but I'm also a fan. CNN: So you don't ever resent her getting more attention than you even when you created the whole band and the music initially? Miller: I actually push that, to be honest. We just did the cover of Spin magazine. When I saw that it's just a beautiful portrait of her, I was like, yes! Thank God! I'm not self-loathing or particularly insecure in my day-to-day, but I really hate being photographed. I hate looking at pictures of myself. I immediately just start tearing it apart. It's a lot like the creative process as well. I'm just really, really hard on myself. I like having her be the face of the band. She loves performing and she loves being photographed and she loves making videos. She looks great and she's confident. I'm the polar opposite. Even live, I'm never front-lit. I prefer to have the music speak for me. CNN: How was it for you to perform on \"Saturday Night Live\"? Miller: I didn't want to do \"SNL,\" but we couldn't say no. You're a total a**hole if you turn it down. The only reason not to do it would be fear of failure. Like I said before, I know failure very well. I don't want to get into it, but I was particularly unimpressed by our performance. I watched it once and I'll never watch it again. But \"SNL\" was an incredible experience. CNN: How did opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on tour come about? Miller: Flea came out to a show in New York City and somebody introduced him to me. He was like, hey, I'm Flea. I obviously knew who he was. He was incredibly nice and he was like, would you guys be interested in playing shows with my band? I was like, you mean the Red Hot Chili Peppers? Sure! It was literally that simple. There was no politicking, no agents or anything. It was just dude to dude. I really appreciated that. I think they're all going to be really great people and I'm pretty psyched on it. They're one of the biggest touring bands on Earth, which is a strange sentence. They're, like, top two or three on the planet. I'm interested to see how a production like that works.\n"

            "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British authorities told CNN Wednesday they are examining a home video that shows singer Amy Winehouse smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she is heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium. The cover of British tabloid The Sun shows a video still of Amy Winehouse smoking a glass pipe. Scotland Yard said it had received the video from The Sun newspaper, which made it public Tuesday. A Grammy-nominated singer, Winehouse's alleged battle with drugs have garnered constant headlines. Her hit song \"Rehab\" describes her reluctance to enter a rehabilitation center, which she did last summer. The tabloid said the 19-minute video was shot Friday in Winehouse's East London home. The Sun posted an edited 2:12 portion of the video on its Web site. The Sun is Britain's best selling daily tabloid newspaper. In the video posted online, Winehouse walks around her home in a dark tank top, talks to a friend on her cell phone, and talks to the person shooting the video.  Watch CNN's report on the video » . At one point, Winehouse says, \"I just took about six Valium.\" Sitting on her bed, she lights a glass pipe and inhales. It's not clear what's in the pipe. Her personal representatives referred CNN to her record company. Her UK label, Island Records, issued a statement saying, \"We are deeply disappointed and upset by these latest revelations and are doing everything we can to offer Amy our full support in dealing with her problems.\" In October, Winehouse and her husband were arrested at a Norwegian hotel for marijuana possession, and soon after fans booed her on stage as she slurred and stumbled her way through her songs. In December, tabloids published pictures of Winehouse with a mystery white powder in her nose. She was also photographed wandering barefoot on a London street, wearing only jeans and a bra, and appearing disoriented. Winehouse's husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, is currently behind bars in London on charges of perverting the course of justice following a bar fight. Her parents have publicly expressed concern that their daughter is succumbing to the pressures of fame. Winehouse received six nominations for next month's Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year for \"Rehab\" and best album for \"Back to Black.\"  E-mail to a friend .\n"

            "(CNN) -- After a year of 10-to-14 hour workdays, the use of seven recording studios and just under $1 million in production costs, Fleetwood Mac's \"Rumours\" was released in 1977 -- and it hasn't fallen out of rotation since. The classic disc was the No. 1 album on the charts for 31 weeks, with Rolling Stone naming \"Rumours\" the 25th greatest album of all time. It is the 10th best-selling album ever with more than 40 million copies sold to date, and it features four top 10 singles. It won the 1977 best album Grammy and, 35 years later, remains the band's most successful effort. Ken Caillat, author of the new book, \"Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album,\" was the iconic album's engineer/co-producer. (He's also the father of Grammy-winning singer Colbie Caillat and produced her No. 1 album, \"Breakthrough.\") \"Rumours,\" Caillat said, is the \"perfect album because it had this really great combination of lyrics and ... well-thought-out musical components,\" he told CNN. \"It's the perfect ride for the perfect time.\" But Fleetwood Mac's story began in another decade on another continent. And as fate would have it, the only two members who were with the group from the start are its namesakes: Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. Fleetwood Mac was originally a blues-format group formed in England in 1967 by Fleetwood, McVie, Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. In 1970, Green left the group and McVie's wife, keyboardist/vocalist Christine McVie, joined. Spencer left that same year, and the late guitarist Bob Welch joined. The group relocated to California in 1974. Welch, who took his own life earlier this month, resigned in December 1974 and was replaced by guitarist/vocalist Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks. By the time Buckingham and Nicks joined, Fleetwood Mac had put out 10 albums but had yet to have a big hit in the U.S. In the book, Caillat described \"Rumours,\" Fleetwood Mac's second album with Nicks and Buckingham, as \"a journey that a handful of people ... took during the mid-1970s.\" It was \"made out of flaws in the human spirit, sometimes through agonizing determination, love, lust, and a force of will that made failure unthinkable.\" Recording began on \"Rumours\" on January 28, 1976, at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California. Twelve days earlier, Caillat had never even heard of the band, but that would soon change because 1975's eponymous \"Fleetwood Mac\" album (\"Rhiannon,\" \"Say You Love Me\") was beginning to climb the charts. \"What's ironic is that throughout the 'Rumours' journey, Fleetwood Mac went from one end of the fame spectrum to the other,\" Caillat noted. \"That day in Sausalito, when we walked into the studio to start recording, they were an established band, but you could hardly say they were rock stars. Before we even released 'Rumours,' that had changed dramatically.\" Although Nicks arguably became the best-known member of Fleetwood Mac, when they first started recording \"Rumours,\" many involved with the project thought she was the band's weakest link, Caillat said. \"She was somewhat of a sweet hippie chick, and she didn't have a lot of technical knowledge about music and instrumentation,\" he said. \"Ultimately, her ethereal songwriting and vocals added a dimension ... that was every bit as essential as any other band member's contributions.\" (Incidentally, Nicks wrote the band's only No. 1 hit, \"Dreams.\") Caillat described Buckingham, who often clashed with band mates, as \"extraordinarily talented\" as well as \"unpredictable,\" \"brilliant but difficult.\" However, Caillat said, \"with Lindsey's contribution ... everyone in the world who'd ever heard a song on the radio would eventually know who Fleetwood Mac was by the time 'Rumours' had run its course.\" In the book, Caillat described the unique way in which Buckingham taught himself guitar. He uses his fingernails instead of a pick, which is quite common, except instead of plucking strings upward individually, he can play more than one string at a time by stroking down --- and up -- with the backs of his nails, which allows him to play several notes at once. Buckingham honed this skill years before joining Fleetwood Mac when he was bedridden with mononucleosis for six months. At the time they were recording the album, all five band mates were going through painful breakups: The McVies were divorcing, Buckingham and Nicks' long-term relationship was coming to a bitter end and Fleetwood's wife was about to leave him for his best friend. It's all personal drama that Caillat chronicles in his book. \"In retrospect, it's a miracle that we were able to finish 'Rumours,' \" he said. \"But later, I came to understand that 'Rumours' probably succeeded because it was brilliant group therapy. ... It's horrible that if it hadn't been for all of the relationship turmoil in the band, you wouldn't know this record any better than some of the previous Fleetwood Mac records.\" Sadness was contagious in the studio, which Caillat said was besieged with arguments, drugs and alcohol. During the summer of '76, the band took a break from recording \"Rumours\" to go on tour to promote their \"Fleetwood Mac\" album. It was the first time Buckingham and Nicks had played in front of a very large crowd, and the concert tour propelled the band to superstardom. Even though \"Fleetwood Mac\" was released in July of 1975, it finally hit No. 1 in September of 1976. As soon as the album began to lose momentum, the record label wanted the band to have the first single off \"Rumours\" -- \"Go Your Own Way\" -- ready to go. Caillat recalled that it was John McVie who came up with the album's title. \"John told us about a brainstorm he had recently had,\" he said. \"With all the rumors flying around about this album, why don't we call the album 'Rumours'? But let's spell it the English way.\" Another major step involved in creating what would become an iconic album was selecting song sequence, which was \"crucial because it can make or break the album's success.\" The idea was to make it compelling and tell a story through music. \"Back then,\" Caillat said, \"running orders were important; and because it was vinyl, you'd put the needle down and listen to side one all the way through to side two, and it was just like going to Six Flags -- you'd get lifted up on a high song and it'd slow down a bit; again, perfect! And I can only take a little bit of credit for that, but I was really proud to be a part of that.\" Caillat told CNN that he believes \"Rumours\" still resonates to this day \"because it's great music. It happened to be created out of a lot of pain and suffering and sincerity and it just so happens that every song is great, every lyric is great, and every song has something that seems to appeal to someone -- except me.\" That's right -- Caillat can no longer bear to listen to \"Rumours.\" \"I see all the little pieces and I can visualize the arguments and I see the assembly of it all,\" he said. \"I can see behind the curtain, so to speak.\" However, part of the reason Caillat knew that the story of \"Rumours\" needed to be told was because \"we experienced something extraordinary, something bigger than all of us.\" In search of the perfect album: Readers weigh in .\n"

            "Los Angeles (CNN) -- If you are parked in front of your TV to watch the Grammys, you only saw a fraction of what happened at the annual music awards show Sunday. In fact, 70 of the 81 trophies were handed out in a pre-telecast ceremony in the Nokia Theatre L.A. LIVE, next to the Staples Center where the last 11 Grammys were presented between a record 20 star-studded performances. Plenty of action takes place backstage where the winners go to talk after they leave the stage, as well. There were hints backstage that the Zac Brown Band, which claimed the best country album Grammy, may be veering into other music genres. \"I love great music of all different kinds,\" Zac Brown said. \"We're just getting started. One project ahead is an acoustic album, Brown said. \"We really control all of our destiny now and all of our rights to everything we do now, so we can really experiment,\" he said. He especially enjoyed the Grammy performances of Rihanna, Sting, Justin Timberlake and Kelly Clarkson, Brown said. Brown used the Grammy weekend to develop relationships with other artists. \"My rolodex got strong this weekend,\" He said. After Carrie Underwood won her sixth Grammy, the latest for best country solo performance, she made it clear backstage that she's sticking to country music and would never cross over into pop music. \"I love that world,\" Underwood said. \"I love the people in it. I love making country music that anybody can get into. If it ever crosses over, then it does it on its on. I don't think I can see myself making a pop album.\" We learned backstage why Jay-Z teased The Dream about the \"Boyz in the Hood\" he was wearing when they accepted their Grammy for best rap/sung collabotation. \"I would like to thank the swap meet for his hat,\" Jay-Z said in his acceptance. \"He was just digging on me,\" The Dream explained backstage. \"Yeah, we do that.\" The trigger for the kiddng was that Jay-Z's wife, Beyonce, had just said she wanted the hat. And in fact, he bought the cap at a swap meet in Compton, Caifornia, he said. The Dream also revealed he would fly to Paris soon to work on an album with Kanye West, who shared the collaboration Grammy with him. \"Hopefully we can get another Grammy together,\" he said. The televised presentations target pop, country, urban, rock, and rap categories, leaving the jazz, gospel, classical, Latin and other categories to the pre-show. The Nokia Theatre was far from full, because many of the 754 individual nominees and their teams were on the red carpet or still getting ready for the big show while the pre-show was under way. But if you were there for the pre-show -- or watched it streamed online -- you would have heard Rihanna, Drake, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Usher, Beyonce and Paul McCartney win Grammys. You still would not have seen them, however, because those stars were not present to accept. You would have seen Taylor Swift making an effort to appear excited and surprised as she accepted a Grammy for best song written for visual media. She won it because she was a co-writer of \"Safe & Sound,\" a song made for \"The Hunger Games\" film. \"This is unbelievable!\" Swift exclaimed. It was her sixth Grammy in her young career. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson also took the pre-telecast stage to accept the Grammy for best historical album. He co-produced \"The Smile Sessions,\" a resurrection of an abandoned Beach Boys album project from 45 years ago. He hinted that the Beach Boys have \"a lot of stuff in the can that hasn't been heard\" and that the group would \"try to get an album together\" this year. Wilson, 70, appeared frail, requiring two men to walk on each side backstage. Janis Ian, another major star from the past, was there to accept a Grammy. Ian called it a \"big upset\" when she beat first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Ellen DeGeneres and Rachel Maddow in the best spoken word category. \"I keep thinking there must be a punchline here,\" Ian joked. \"An ex-president and the first lady and three lesbians walk into a bar.\" Ian won for narrating \"Society's Child: My Autobiography.\" It was just her second Grammy after nine nominations in eight different categories. \"I made a choice to be a songwriter and not be part of the circus all the time. I don't do popular music because that's not what I'm good at,\" Ian said backstage. Bonnie Raitt was there to get her 10th Grammy, the latest for best Americana album given for \"Slipstream.\" \"I didn't expect this,\" Raitt said. \"I have enough.\" Jazz legend Pat Metheny took home his 20th Grammy out of 36 nominated. The latest for best jazz instrumental album, given to him for \"Unity Band.\" Esperanza Spalding, the bass-playing jazz singer whose best new artist win upset Justin Bieber fans two years ago, was present to win two more Grammys in the pre-telecast. Spalding, 28, won for best instrumental arrangement accompanying vocalists and for best jazz vocal album for \"Radio Music Society.\" Drake, whom Spalding also beat two years ago for best new artist, may now wish he had been there because the rapper was awarded his first Grammy after 13 nominations. Then again, he also lost twice Sunday when Jay-Z and Kanye West beat him in the best rap song and best rap performance categories. Paul McCartney was a no-show to pick up his Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album. It was awarded for his \"Kisses on the Bottom\" album. While there are plenty of household names announced in the pre-show, it is also the chance for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to honor people who perform important jobs for the music industry. For example, Billy Vera won a Grammy for writing the best album notes. He composed the notes for an album of Ray Charles music, \"Singular Genius: The Complete ABC Singles.\" Fritz Klaetke, the art director for \"Woody At 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection,\" won a Grammy for producing the best boxed or special limited edition package. While this may seem to be the most unglamorous of all Grammys, Klaetke said the category was important for \"recognizing the role packaging design plays in these days of downloaded music.\"\n"

            "(RollingStone.com) -- Save for some bit roles in a smattering of unremarkable TV shows, the world hasn't heard much from Ben Savage since 2000. That's when his reign as Cory Matthews, the lovable goofball lead on the seminal Nineties sitcom \"Boy Meets World,\" came to an end. But last week, with one tweet, Savage returned to our lives: \"I'm going to be a father!\" the 32-year-old wrote. \"Well, on TV at least. The 'Boy Meets World' sequel is officially happening!\" Yes, much to the delight of twentysomething TGIF aficionados everywhere, \"Boy Meets World\" is getting a reboot. Titled \"Girl Meets World,\" the spinoff series, which is set to begin shooting in February and will air on the Disney Channel, stars both Savage and Danielle Fishel (as his wife, Topanga Lawrence) and follows the couple's experience raising a 13-year-old daughter. Rolling Stone needed more answers, so we rang up Savage to find which, if any, old cast members would be returning, and how he's preparing for impending fatherhood. Rolling Stone: Congratulations are in order. What has life been like since the Girl Meets World announcement? Ben Savage: It's been pretty . . . I'm gonna say pretty exciting. Let's leave it at that. RS: Are you surprised at how insanely happy people are about this? Savage: Well, it was very nice. I'll say it was exciting and flattering that people are still so excited about the show after all this time. 100 Best Albums of the Nineties . RS: The show's popularity is tied into people's Nineties-related nostalgia. How aware were you of the show's revered status among people of a certain age? Savage: I mean, I knew it was a highly-regarded show, and I know it holds a special place in people's hearts after all this time. Like I said, it's very flattering. But, you know, the other thing is, it was a big part of my childhood as well. As important as it is to a lot of fans and a lot of people who watched our show, it's just as important to me after all this time. It was an integral part of my life too, obviously. RS: Apparently it was a big part of Snooki's and Brooklyn Decker's, as well. Savage: It's a little ridiculous. It's very nice, though. All of it is very flattering. I know a lot of people grew up with that show. The funny thing is, back then -- and it sounds like I'm talking about some prehistoric age -- it was not long ago we didn't have as much options of cable television and Internet. And we were all kind of in the same place at one point just watching TGIF on Friday nights. And so, to a lot of people, this show means a lot. RS: Thanks to your role as Cory Matthews and your brother Fred's as Kevin Arnold on \"The Wonder Years,\" many people feel they know the Savage family on an intimate level. Savage: At the risk of using this word too often, it's flattering. And it's very nice that people think of us that way. It's nice that we have a special bond with the public. RS: Much of the show's success and continued popularity over the years is due to its ability to speak to both kids and adults. Savage: I guess it was kind of a hybrid of a kids' show and an adult show. We were just having fun on that show. Everyone was just kind of having a blast. The writers were a lot of fun. And the directors were always fun. And the acting was always fun. It was just a fun experience. So hopefully that came across to our viewers. At the same time, we tried to communicate some sort of message that was somewhat wholesome and had some sort of meaning. And I think people appreciate it. I think people can really appreciate a show with a good message, but one that does that with some humor. Nineties fashion gets a second spin . RS: Had the idea for a Boy Meets World sequel come up over the years? Savage: In an official capacity, no. This was really the first time where it had sort of been mentioned in an official way. I mean, people have been discussing it for a long time -- some sort of movie-of-the-week or some sort of, I guess, some sort of film about the show. But I think that everyone associated with the show wanted to make sure that if we were to come back, that we weren't going to do it in a way that was going to be a disservice to the show. No one wanted to really cash in, if you will, too early, or no one really wanted to do something that was going to be cheesy. So when we all decided to get together for this, there were a lot of discussions. I mean, this has been going on for months in an unofficial way. But the build-up to this Girl Meets World series, there was a lot of discussions and a lot of conversations to make sure we were all on the same page about what we were doing. RS: Were you hesitant to sign on? Savage: Let me say this: It wasn't that I was resistant . . . I think it was just a matter of making sure all of us were on the same page about what we were going to do in terms of making the show last another seven years, hopefully. There were different options around of following our characters or following this. But it just seems a little poetic that we're coming back 13 years later and it's following our daughter's character. I like that concept, because it's very poetic and it's kind of passing it off to the next generation. RS: The sequel wouldn't have worked without both you and Danielle Fishel returning. Savage: It was interesting how it came together. But Danielle and I had definitely had a lot of discussions of what we wanted to do, and if we were both onboard. Again, just making sure that everything was right and we felt right about it. Listen, the people that are doing the show -- Michael Jacobs is the executive producer -- they know what we're about, and they know what we're looking for. I guess it's also a matter of trust that we're all on the same page. ' 'Boy Meets World': Where are they now? RS: A lot of people are wondering if other original cast members, such as Rider Strong's Shawn or Bill Daniels' Mr. Feeny, will be back in the mix. Savage: We're going to wait and see what happens. Obviously, I don't want to give away too many details. But there's definitely been discussions about some of everyone's favorite characters popping up in the show and making appearances. We'll see what happens. RS: We'd like to see a return of Lee Norris' Stuart Minkus. Savage: [laughs] That's definitely an interesting way to go. I'm not sure when he stopped being on the show. I'm not sure, but I'm definitely in favor of a return of Minkus. Why not? RS: When do you start shooting? Savage: We start shooting, I think, February of next year. RS: Some people are worried the show will be a bust. Savage: We want to do justice to the characters, and we want to make sure we respect people's memories of the show. It's funny, a lot of the tweets and emails and mentions I've gotten are from a lot of people who are worried that the show wont' hold up. And that we shouldn't do it because it's going to ruin a lot of their childhood memories. And I totally can understand that -- I get it. I know there are things that they've done in the past where I feel like it's ruined my childhood memories. And I didn't like that. But we're really working hard and doing everything we can to make sure that this is going to be something special and funny, and hopefully it'll make new memories for a new generation. RS: How does it feel knowing you're about to be a father -- onscreen, that is? Savage: Well, I dunno [laughs]. In real life I've just been an uncle up to this point. Which has been great -- it's a nice role. We'll see how fatherhood works for me. Rolling Stone looks back on nineties with new anthology . RS: Maybe you can draw from your experiences as an uncle for the role. Savage: Perhaps. I think it's slightly different. Being an uncle is easy. You just get to stick around for the fun pasts. RS: No babies waking you up in the middle of the night. Savage: Exactly. RS: Have you started the casting process for the role of yours and Danielle's daughter? Savage: We're working on that right now. There have been a few names tossed around. We're meeting with girls and auditioning and that whole process. You know, we're slowly trying to find the perfect girl. RS: Lastly, how often do random strangers call you Cory? Savage: It's a bit of a humblebrag if I make that complaint. I'll just say, again, going back to our favorite word, it's always very flattering when people recognize me. See original story at RollingStone.com.\n"

            "(Rolling Stone) -- The returning Justin Timberlake and upstart rappers Macklemore and Ryan Lewis top the list of best-selling recording artists at the midyear point of 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan. As of June 30, Timberlake's \"The 20/20 Experience\" has sold just over two million copies -- the only album to do so thus far this year. Best Albums of 2013: Mid-year Report . The rest of the top five best-selling albums include Bruno Mars' \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" (985,000 copies sold this year after a December release), Mumford & Sons' nine-month-old \"Babel\" (884,000 sold in addition to 1.46 million sold by the end of last year), Blake Shelton's \"Based on a True Story . . .\" (703,000) and Imagine Dragons' \"Night Visions\" (692,000).

            "(CNN) -- Summer is the best time for outdoor musical festivals and blasting music with all the windows open. We've done the legwork for you, and compiled what should be some of the best albums of the season, and the most tent-worthy festivals, organized by region. Find the ear candy that suits your taste best, and get busy listening: . ALBUMS . Queens of the Stone Age, \"... Like Clockwork,\" due June 4 . The band's sixth album, a follow-up to \"Era Vulgaris,\" welcomes founding bassist Nick Oliveri back into the band, and includes guest spots by Dave Grohl, Elton John, Trent Reznor, Mark Lanegan, Brody Dalle and Jake Shears, among others. It's one of the first meaty rock records of the summer and can be heard here. The Lonely Island, \"The Wack Album,\" due June 11 . An anecdote to the oh-so-earnest music out there, Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer are back with the hilarity, with help from friends Solange, Maya Rudolph, T-Pain, Adam Levine, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams and more. \"Semicolon\" is a twisted update of \"Schoolhouse Rock,\" while \"Spring Break Anthem\" takes bromance to its logical conclusion. Kanye West, \"Yeezus,\" due June 18 . His follow-up to \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" is supposed to be a game-changer -- and we hope that doesn't mean too many Kim Kardashian songs such as \"Baby You're Awesome,\" which he played at the Met Ball and the Adult Swim upfront. A sneak peek of tracks \"Black Skinhead\" and \"New Slaves\" on \"Saturday Night Live\" suggest that he's been listening to a lot of DMX, while his collaborators include Daft Punk, Skrillex, John Legend, members of Odd Future, No I.D., Pusha T and Chief Keef. Potential tracks \"I Am a God\" and \"I Am Not a Celebrity\" also suggest 'Ye isn't leaving his ego at the door. The 20 best summer 2013 movies . Sigur RÃ³s, \"Kveikur,\" due June 18 . Now that multi-instrumentalist Kjartan Sveinsson's left to go compose elsewhere, the Icelandic band's sound has transformed from ambient music/dream-rock to something harder and darker, as indicated by first-released tracks \"Brennisteinn\" and \"Isjaki,\" which venture further into prog-metal. Don't worry, the gorgeous falsettos are still intact. MGMT, \"MGMT,\" June TBA . The duo's synth-heavy follow-up to \"Congratulations\" features influences by Aphex Twin and house music and was recorded with longtime Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann, which only can mean one thing -- expect it to be trippy. The first sneak peek track, \"Alien Days,\" was released on cassette for Record Store Day last month. The album is expected to include a version of Faine Jade's garage rocker \"Introspection\" as well as new track \"Mystery Disease.\" What's new this summer on TV? Wu-Tang Clan, \"A Better Tomorrow,\" July TBA . For the 20th anniversary of \"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),\" the Staten Island hip-hop group has a new and possibly final album, named after their 1997 track, \"A Better Tomorrow.\" RZA told The New York Times that the group has one last mission: \"We need to, one time, completely, efficiently, properly represent our brand,\" while Ghostface Killah told the Guardian, \"We got verses and s---, but you gotta make sure it's right. Don't rush it.\" Take your time. M.I.A., \"Mitangi,\" summer TBA . The full album was supposed to be out in April, but the Sri Lankan rapper gave us a taste of her new music (outside of last year's\"Bad Girls\") during Paris Fashion Week for the runway show of the Japanese brand Kenzo. Advance word on \"Mitangi\" was that it was more upbeat than usual (\"Come Walk With Me\"), but leaked track \"AtTENTion\" is a bit darker: \"My existence is militant.\" M.I.A. has said on Twitter that there are \"no collabs\" on this album, although she worked with producers Hit-Boy and So Japan, whose Kyle Edwards told MTV the album has \"a lot more bounce to it.\" Beyonce, \"Mrs. Carter,\" summer TBA . Queen B has treated us to a few tracks so far from her fifth studio album -- \"Grown Woman,\" \"Standing on the Sun,\" \"Bow Down/I Been On\" -- so we know she's working on it. The only question is how much remains to be done before release, since she's currently on tour. Speaking of which ... FESTIVALS . Sure, most of your favorite artists are on tour this summer -- from Beyonce to Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake to Taylor Swift -- but you'll get more bang for your buck if you check out one of the many music festivals around the country. You might even discover a new fave artist while you're there: . West Coast . If you're on the West Cost (or thereabouts), you might want to go to Bumbershoot in Seattle August 31-September 2 (Labor Day weekend). The lineup at Bumbershoot includes fun., Death Cab for Cutie, MGMT, Bob Mould, The Breeders, Matt & Kim and Heart. Death Cab for Cutie plans to play the 2003 album \"Transatlanticism\" in its entirety. (You know, the one from which Seth had the poster on his wall in \"The O.C.\") Also, the Experience Music Project will host an electronic dance music stage. Those farther south on the coast might want to hit up Outside Lands in San Francisco August 9-11 which will include Red Hot Chili Peppers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Vampire Weekend and Willie Nelson. Midwest . If you're in the Midwest (or thereabouts), Lollapalooza in Chicago's Grant Park should be your destination August 2-4. The lineup includes Phoenix, Lana Del Rey, Queens of the Stone Age, The Cure, The Killers, The National, The Postal Service, Nine Inch Nails, Grizzly Bear and Ellie Goulding, plus plenty more. Granted, it's not the same as when Lollapalooza actually toured the country, but this is great for one-stop shopping to fulfill your summer music needs. Also in the Midwest, Kanrockas in Kansas City, Kansas, June 28-29 -- with Kendrick Lamar, Passion Pit, Pretty Lights, Tiesto and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. East Coast . Folks on the East Coast should try their luck at the Governor's Ball in New York June 7-9, which Kanye West is headlining (Guns N' Roses are slated to make an appearance, but you never know with Axl Rose). Also on the bill are the Lumineers, Kendrick Lamar and Kings of Leon. A little farther away from the Big Apple is the sure-to-be-eventful Hot 97 Summer Jam on June 2 in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which includes more Kendrick Lamar, plus A$AP Rocky, Wu-Tang Clan, Fabolous, Wale and Miguel. The Firefly Music Festival in Dover, Delaware, June 21-23 offers the Alabama Shakes, Tom Petty, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Vampire Weekend, while the Budweiser Made in America fest in Philadelphia August 31-September 1 has Beyonce leading a lineup curated by her hubby Jay-Z: Public Enemy, Phoenix, Emeli Sande, Deadmau5, Wiz Khalifa, Nine Inch Nails, Queens of the Stone Age and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. (If Hova's doc \"Jay-Z: Made in America\" is released first, watch it to get amped). The South . Down South, big festivals await. Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee, June 13-16 has an eclectic lineup this year, with seasoned vets (Paul McCartney, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, David Byrne) facing off against typical festival fare (Mumford & Sons, Wilco, The Lumineers) and some beyond the norm choices (BjÃ¶rk, R. Kelly, Wu-Tang Clan). And then there's the comedy lineup, featuring David Cross (in case you didn't get enough of him in the new season of \"Arrested Development\"), Ed Helms (ditto for \"The Hangover III\"), and Bob Saget, who will probably work blue. Meanwhile, the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans July 4 weekend will cool off with Jill Scott, Keyshia Cole, LL Cool J, Maxwell, Brandy and who else -- Beyonce. Does that mean we'll have to wait a little longer for her new album? We've got all summer.\n"

            "(CNN) -- The Kills celebrated the 10th anniversary of their first live gig with a concert/blowout party in New York this past weekend. Other rockers might not remember the exact date of their first gig, but it's easy for singer Alison Mosshart to recall: She has the date tattooed on her hand. You probably haven't heard the Kills on the radio. But you may have heard their songs on TV shows like \"House,\" \"True Blood,\" and \"Cops\" and not known it. And if you're into more mainstream rock, or celebrity gossip, you've probably read about Mosshart and co-Kill Jamie Hince for other reasons. Mosshart moonlights as the lead singer for one of Jack White's two post-White Stripes bands, the Dead Weather. Hince married supermodel Kate Moss last year in a wedding breathlessly covered by the British press. Despite their busy lives outside the Kills, Mosshart and Hince still passionately focus on the band that changed their lives. Hince said when the duo started as \"an odd two-piece social group ... I think our souls knew we would still be doing it [10 years later], but I don't think our brains did.\" \"This band might never be a global phenomenon, but it's the most successful thing in the world to me,\" Hince said. Serendipity brought the two together. When Florida native Mosshart was touring Britain with her band, they stayed in a London flat that happened to be below Hince's apartment. \"I'd be making a noise, playing guitar and stuff, and unbeknownst to me, she was outside my window, listening,\" Hince recalled, \"When we actually first spoke, she probably knew a lot more about me than I realized, because she'd been sort of listening to me playing for about a week.\" Mosshart soon moved to London to join forces with Hince, but there was one problem: She didn't play an instrument. \"We presumed we would be a normal band with this orthodox band set up, with a drummer and a keyboard player and a bass player,\" Hince said. \"While we were talking about it, we'd also be writing songs together. Then, we'd talk further about what kind of drummer we wanted. Then, we'd play some more music. A week would go by, and two weeks. Then, a month, and two months. And we'd got a mountain of songs and we listened back to ourselves, and it sounded like a band, and we just stopped talking about meeting other people.\" Mosshart said sounding like a band wasn't so easy at first, \"He kind of had to re-learn guitar entirely because of me, because we were a two-piece band and I didn't know how to play anything. So, he had to develop this guitar style that was like playing bass and guitar at the same time to compensate for me.\" Ten years later, Mosshart plays guitar, drums, and keyboards in concert, as well as ferociously prowling the stage as the lead singer. While the Kills are incorporating two drummers into some songs on their current tour, they play many tunes the way they're created on record, with just the two Kills and a drum machine. Mosshart worries that opens up a lot of possibilities for error on stage. \"Two of us playing to a drum machine is like walking a tightrope, because if you take the wrong turn at any point, you're off, and you're off somewhere all by yourself ... and that's kind of it for the song,\" she said. Despite those fears, you shouldn't expect to hear ornate orchestration in any Kills songs anytime soon. \"I think it's more important what you leave out of a song than what you put in it,\" Hince said. \"The only thing you need on a song is that attitude and that burning electricity. You don't need layers of music or, you know, a thousand drums, or string sections. You don't even need an electric guitar to be electric.\" \"I think that minimalist sound is really attractive to us, just kind of instinctually,\" Mosshart added. \"We'll try a lot of things and we usually get rid of almost everything. We just kind of leave the stuff that we think is important, because it sounds the best to us.\" That minimalism has been a hallmark of edgy rock bands for more than 45 years, since the Velvet Underground, the \"house band\" for Andy Warhol's Factory in the '60s, \"created\" the sound. When Hince and Mosshart first met, they bonded over a shared love of the Warhol scene. \"All that time was so romantic and beautiful, because there weren't a bunch of bands that were part of the scene. There weren't a bunch of artists that were part of the scene. It was just the Velvet Underground and these kinds of freaks, and these people with fake names, and these drag queens, and Andy Warhol, and then, these photographers,\" Mosshart said. \"That appealed to us so much, because that's kind of what we grew up doing. We wanted to do everything. We didn't just want to do one thing. We didn't just want to be in a band. We didn't just want to be artists.\" The Kills display multimedia skills, producing artwork and photos for their CD jackets, creating pamphlets of Polaroids to hand out at concerts and even generating the concepts for many of their music videos. The disturbing video for 2008's \"Last Day of Magic\" depicts the couple beating each other in back alleys and bedrooms. A lot of articles over the years have alluded to sexual tension between Hince and Mosshart, but both insist romance has never been part of their dynamic. \"I think it's really difficult for people to see a friendship -- not just a friendship between a man and a woman, but a creative, productive relationship. People do find it really hard to see that it could be possible, without there being some kind of regular love interest around it,\" Hince said. \"I always wanted to be in this kind of creative, artistic relationship that was beyond anything else, and it's like we willed it. We kind of yearned for it and we willed it, and we got it.\" They also yearned for -- and are getting -- more mainstream recognition. \"It's incredible when you go somewhere like South America and kids are going bananas to you and you've never been there before,\" Hince said. \"Equally, when Rolling Stone names this band I still see as this little sort of underground band, names [the Kills' latest album Blood Pressures] as one of the best albums of [2011], it means the world to me.\" \"I have this very strong feeling that we need to be part of the world,\" Mosshart said. \"If you're not, what are you doing?\"\n"

            "(RollingStone.com) -- There was no shortage of drama on Alanis Morissette's debut, \"Jagged Little Pill.\" So much so that the singer is expanding her 1995 LP into a Broadway musical that will encompass all the songs on the album, as well as other tracks from her catalog and new original tunes she will compose for the stage. Tony and Pulitzer winner Tom Kitt, who worked on Green Day's \"American Idiot\" musical, will provide orchestration and arrangements for the musical, also called \"Jagged Little Pill,\" and Broadway veteran Vivek J. Tiwary will produce the musical with Arvind Ethan David. \"Jagged Little Pill\" is expected to debut as a workshop production next year. Where does 'Jagged Little Pill' rank on our best albums of the '90s list? \"I look forward to taking the heart of 'Jagged Little Pill' and expanding its story, fleshing it out into ever deeper layers of emotionality, specificity, humanity, power, physicality, spirit and fabulism,\" Morissette said in announcing the musical. \"I look forward to collaborating with Vivek and Tom and our whole inspiring team to create something greater than the sum of our parts.\" In album form, \"Jagged Little Pill\" has sold more than 33 million copies worldwide, peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.

            "(RS) -- After launching her Caesars Palace residency last December with a series of sold-out dates, Shania Twain, country music's biggest-selling female artist of all time, is returning to Vegas for another series of dates that kick off October 15th and run through mid-December. With the show entering its second year, Twain can turn her attention to her next album, her first since 2002's \"Up!.\" Speaking to Rolling Stone from her longtime home of Switzerland, the superstar tells us she has most of the songs in place for the next record and is gearing up to find a producer and define the sound of the album. How is the album coming? I'm pretty much there with my songs, and I'm really just sitting on the fence in regards to a producer. So I'm listening to a lot of records, doing my homework there, and trying to determine who is the right match. Are there people who stand out to you as you listen to records? This is last year, but I'm really stuck on Lana Del Rey. I've been listening to that one a lot more and kind of stuck on the sound of that record. I really love \"Raising Sand\" as well -- Alison Krauss and Robert Plant. So that goes to show you how lost I am as far as production direction, because I'm listening to such a broad spectrum. Both of those productions really appeal to me, and the direction that they took -- just trying to get ideas for myself. Best Albums of 2013: Mid-Year Report . Is there more internal pressure because it has been so long? Yeah, of course. I do want it to be perfect, and I want it to be something that I really enjoy and a product of my inspiration -- not a product of necessarily anything I've done before or anyone I've been before in regards to making records, because it's been a long time. I'm different, I've evolved, and I want that to be reflected in the music. At the same time I don't want to abandon the root of what I am. So it's just really determining where am I really at and just looking through that. It's not as obvious as it seems it should be. What are the songs that have really jumped out at you, and what can you tell us about the ones you have so far? There are probably less upbeat songs. I would say it's more half and half compared to what I would've done in the past, where I would've leaned more towards mostly uptempo songs. I still want to remain positive with my lyrics and stay in that mode with my music, because I enjoy uplifting myself, if you will, with my songs. But at the same time I'm going deeper, and I'm being more realistic with my point of view on things. It's really such a personal journey making a record, but even more so writing the songs. And you feel a bit obsessed about them at this stage as well, I think, because until they get to a producer they're still yours, at this stage where I'm at now. So maybe letting go is going to be a little bit difficult, and I know that when I involve a producer that's sort of what will happen to a degree. Of course I'll remain very involved, but I guess I've just got to get out there and meet these producers face-to-face and talk through. I've just got to get myself to that next stage. 'Raising Sand' was produced by T Bone Burnett. I'd love to see that collaboration, but there are so many good producers out there. There's a lot of choice. It's overwhelming, and it's overwhelming trying to pinpoint who to go with on this project, because it will determine a lot of the direction, and I'm committing myself. It's that fear of committing myself once and for all and locking myself in. That's what scares me the most, really. And I've had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around, changing my mind. And that's part of the whole thing of being creative -- until you commit, you can change your mind and rewrite it and create a new melody and change the story. And at some point that's got to end. And that is the point when you actually make the records. So letting go of that phase of it is probably my biggest hesitation. On the Charts: Luke Bryan Edges Out John Mayer . Any chance you'll preview new material in Vegas? I think it's too soon. I probably could start doing that, but I don't want to get locked into a performance mode with a song, either, until I've taken it a little further down the line. Just talking it through, like we're doing now, does help. And it gets me in that mindset. It's probably the right time now to start taking it more seriously as far as getting into the studio, especially since I'm finished producing the show. The show took well over a year to put together, so that was a production in itself, like making a record. You had to write the whole story -- literally wrote the show out like a script, worked through the production and had the technical side of it and eventually delivered it. So I'm only recently freed up from going into one production and just getting geared up to go into another one, which should be the record. Were there tours or performances that inspired you in creating this Vegas show? What we can do in that room I really wouldn't be able to do anywhere else -- certainly not tour with it, because the technology is so sophisticated you can't really move around with it. So the joy of having that high-end technology and taking advantage of that was a huge part of the excitement for me, and the margins where I can go and take it are just so broad in comparison to touring. So I wrote the show with all of that in mind, knowing I would have all this technology available -- this great room, the acoustics and this giant stage and everything like that. So I almost shot it more like a music video, all of my more iconic music videos or images, and based it from there. I wanted to bring those more alive, so I used that as the influence in regards to the fashion and the look of things. I want it to be familiar to people as well. I want them to reminisce, but I wanted them to see things in a more refreshed, contemporary way. Then there was the fun part of picking the director and giving them all my ideas, my wish list, and asking them all, \"Which ones do you think you can realize, and how would you make them happen?\" And then the spine of the show was the song list. I want people to hear the songs they know. I want people to hear the hits and I want them to be satisfied in that regard. It always disappoints me when I go to a concert and they don't play my favorite song, or at least one of their biggest hits. That process, for me, even without being the performer, was a fantastic experience, and really the big reason why I didn't plunge into the record right away. I needed that year just to write the show, to create it and build it. I know you've seen a lot of shows of late as well. What blew you away? Sting I've seen a few times and he really inspired me, in the sense that he breaks the songs down a lot and will take a different approach. He'll take an acoustic approach to them, he'll rearrange them for the live stage. And I thought, \"I really admire someone taking the license to do that, owning that.\" I played around with that a little bit in the show as well, so that was an influence. I really admire artists that are willing to take a different approach and a different angle to their shows. So I did some of that. See the original story at RollingStone.com.

            "(CNN) -- Rolling Stone has announced its choice for the best album of 2014. And it may also be the most hated album of 2014. The honor goes to U2's \"Songs of Innocence,\" which annoyed many listeners in September when it was automatically sent to the accounts of 500 million active iTunes users, without their consent, as part of an Apple promotion. Although the album was free, some users grumbled that the distribution method was invasive. Frontman Bono later apologized, saying the band \"got carried away with ourselves.\" \"There was no bigger album of 2014 -- in terms of surprise, generosity and controversy,\" Rolling Stone's editors said Monday in defending their choice. \"Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. put their lives on the line: giving away 11 songs of guitar rapture and frank, emotional tales of how they became a band out of the rough streets and spiritual ferment of Seventies Dublin.\" Much of the Internet, however, howled in laughter and protest. \"U2 actually just appeared on the Rolling Stone AOTY list and RS didn't know how to delete it,\" wrote one Twitter user. \"In case anyone was wondering if Rolling Stone's opinions on music were still relevant, they named U2's new album the best of the year, so...\" said another. As a pop-culture magazine founded in the 1960s, Rolling Stone is often viewed as being less daring in its tastes than online rivals such as Pitchfork, which gave \"Songs of Innocence\" a 4.6 out of 10. Although U2 remains one of the biggest artists in the world, the band's popularity has slumped over the past decade. \"Songs of Innocence\" has received little airplay and mixed responses from critics, reflected by its score of 65 out of 100 on Metacritic, which aggregates reviews. In ranking their top 50 albums of the year, Rolling Stone chose U2 over high-profile releases from Bruce Springsteen (#2), The Black Keys (#3), Taylor Swift (#10) and others. Many of 2014's top sellers, including releases by Beyonce, Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith, did not make the list.\n"

            "Weary parents, doomed to hear \"Let it Go\" on a loop until the end of time, made the \"Frozen\" soundtrack the most downloaded album of the year on iTunes. Every year, Apple releases its lists of the top downloads, along with a selection of \"best of\" content on iTunes, chosen by Apple staff. This year, Elsa and friends were all over Apple's most-purchased charts. \"Frozen\" was the most downloaded movie of the year, and the single \"Let it Go\" was the eighth most-popular song. Kids (and kids at heart) were a driving force behind many of the top iTunes purchases this year. \"Minecraft\" was the most popular paid iPad app and second most-purchased iPhone app. \"The Lego Movie\" was the second most-downloaded movie and was Apple's pick for best family movie. Young adult book \"The Fault in Our Stars\" was the most popular fiction title, and YA hit \"Divergent\" was the top-selling audio book. We hope the children weren't watching the most-downloaded TV shows. \"Game of Thrones\" topped the list, followed by \"The Walking Dead,\" \"Downton Abbey,\" \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Scandal.\" Facebook's plan to force its users to download the stand-alone Facebook Messenger app seems to have worked -- it was the year's most popular free iPhone app. Microsoft Word was only the fifth most-popular free iPad app, coming in behind YouTube, Netflix, Skype and a weather app. In addition to naming its biggest moneymakers, Apple highlights what it thinks are the best movies, performances and apps of the year. The company safely dodged any controversy by naming Beyonce best artist and Taylor Swift's \"1989\" as best album of the year. Other picks were \"Fargo\" the year's best TV show, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson for best TV performances, and \"Key & Peele\" for best breakthrough TV show. Comedian Jenny Slate's movie \"Obvious Child\" was the best discovery and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" best blockbuster. Brain training app Elevate is the company's pick for best app of the year and \"Threes!\" is the best game of the year. Runaway true-crime hit \"Serial\" was anointed the best new podcast of the year. \"Serial\" is still iTunes' most downloaded podcast around the world right now, having been downloaded 5 million times.\n"

            "(CNN)It's not easy to squeeze 40 years of show into one anniversary special, but \"Saturday Night Live\" gave it a go on Sunday night. From the Jimmy Fallon/Justin Timberlake opening to the return of Eddie Murphy and musical performances by the likes of lightning rod artists Kanye West  and Miley Cyrus (who offered a surprisingly charming version of \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\"), it was an evening of mockery and fond remembrances for the \"SNL\" 40th anniversary special. Why 'Saturday Night Live' is still awesome . Here are some highlights: . Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake get musical . Could NBC please just give these two their own show already? We already knew that Fallon and Timberlake are magical, thanks to their \"History of Rap\" skits on Fallon's \"Tonight Show.\" On Sunday night, they opened the special episode with a musical number celebrating some of the show's most famous catchphrases. Three cheers for Timberlake's Schweddy balls! Betty White makes out with Bradley Cooper . \"The Californians\" skit was already pretty awesome, with Taylor Swift and Kerry Washington joining cast members past and present (Laraine Newman even showed up!), but then 93-year-old White locked lips with 40-year-old Cooper. Wow. The return of Eddie Murphy . We won't say much about this one even though it was eagerly anticipated. After a 30-year absence from \"SNL,\" Murphy returned for all of 73 seconds. Introduced by Chris Rock, the actor received a standing ovation and offered a few words including \"I will always love this show,\" and that was that. It was brief and awkward. Welcome back, \"Wayne's World\" Mike Myers and Dana Carvey returned as the beloved characters Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar for an \"SNL\" Top 10. In announcing No. 6 -- musical guests -- Carvey as Garth said, \"I think Beck was one of the best, even better than Beyonce.\" That was the perfect segue into No. 5: \"Kanye, sit down,\" a reference to the artist's recent lament that Beck should not have beat out Beyonce for best album at the 2015 Grammys. West was in the audience, and at one point we got to see him play along as security \"restrained\" him. Way to have a sense of humor about it, Ye. Party on! Excellent! Celebrity \"Jeopardy!\" Will Ferrell as Alex Trebek is always at his best when paired with Darrell Hammond's borderline-NSFW Sean Connery, but this episode also gave us the delight that is Kate McKinnon as Justin Bieber and Alec Baldwin as Tony Bennett. When the other \"celebs\" showed up, it was hard to keep it together. Jim Carrey's Matthew McConaughey was pretty spot-on.\n"

It became a symbol of Russia’s struggle against the German bombings of the Second World War. But now - almost four decades after Dmitri Shostakovich died - his Symphony No. 7 is back in the public eye after its incorporation into a chart song was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. Ill Manors by Plan B has been shortlisted for Best Contemporary Song at the prestigious awards and will compete against Fitzpleasure by Mercury Prize winners Alt-J and Pelican by The Maccabees. Scroll down for video . Link: Almost four decades after Dmitri Shostakovich (left) died - his Symphony No. 7 is back in the public eye after its incorporation into a chart song by Plan B (right) was nominated for an Ivor Novello award . Plan B - stage name of rapper Ben Drew - wrote the song in response to the London 2011 riots and featured a sample of the fourth movement of Shostakovich’s symphony, reported The Independent. The Russian composer’s work was first performed in 1942 and dedicated to Leningrad’s citizens. In the Novellos, he was credited in Plan B’s song as a co-songwriter of the hit, along with four others. Pianist Shostakovich died in 1975 and was one of the most popular composers of the 20th century. He composed his first symphony aged 19, but in 1936 Joseph Stalin was dismayed by a performance of his opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District - and state media slammed the ‘bedlam of noise’. However Shostakovich then produced his Fifth Symphony, which was a hit with Soviet dictator Stalin thanks to its message of victory emerging from adversity - and he became a musical hero. Triumphant year: Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sande, 26, was nominated in both the best song and a most performed work category in the Novellos . Scottish singer-songwriter Emeli Sande, 26, was nominated in both the best song and a most performed work category in the Novellos. It has been a triumphant 12 months for Sande, who won best British female artist and best album at the BRIT Awards and sang at the opening and closing ceremonies of the London 2012 Olympics. Leeds-based indie rock quartet Alt-J were also nominated for the album award for An Awesome Wave, while Plan B's Ill Manors was also up for best original film score. The 58th Ivor Novello Awards, to be presented on May 16, are judged by the music writing community and are regarded as the most important awards for British music writers.

            "By . Lucy Buckland . PUBLISHED: . 02:34 EST, 21 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:56 EST, 21 February 2013 . She triumphed at this year's BRIT Awards so it was only fitting that the toast of the ceremony headed out to celebrate, . Scottish singer Sandé simply kicked off her heels and descended into the ROC Nation after-party with one thing on her blonde quiff - celebration. The 25-year-old former medical student took to Twitter after scooping her two awards, writing: 'If I don't party tonight... then I'll never party' and a friend shared a picture of the singer grinning as she held a glass of champagne. 'If I don't party tonight then I'll never party': Sandé heads out after collecting two BRIT Awards, in the very same outfit she wore to the ceremony . Sandé, who wore a pretty clinging floral dress for the ceremony showed her down-to-earth style status by shunning the multiple outfit changes adopted by contemporaries Rita Ora and simply slipped into some navy trainers. Sandé, whose debut alum Our Version Of Events picked up best album, looked more than happy to bask in her success after a busy summer - the married star opened the Olympic ceremony this year to critical acclaim. Accepting her award for British Female Solo Artist - presented to her by Taylor Swift - Emeli said: 'Wow, this is amazing, this is incredible, I'm so happy to win this. I was up against so many wonderful artists. Toast of the BRIT Awards: Emeli shared this Twitter snap of her backstage at the show with some champagne . Celebration: Emeli was ready to revel in her double BRIT success . 'Thank you to my wonderful family, my mum, dad, my wonderful husband. Thank you to everyone who believed in me.' Picking up Best Album later in the night, she added: 'I think I'm a very lucky pop star. This is an album I wrote because I didn't have the strength to say these things. The fact that people have connected with these songs doesn't make me feel so lonely. 'This is a dream really. Thank you for this award and thank you for this year.' Singer-songwriter: Emeli was ready to live it up as she headed into the Three Six Zero and Roc Nation Brit awards after party . Lovely and leggy: Kelly Brook looked ultra-slim as she arrived for the bash in a thigh-skimming black skirt . Looking lovely: Kelly showed no sign of putting on weight as she arrived at the party - despite Katie Price's slurs earlier this month . Other famous faces at the Three Six Zero Group and ROC Nation party, at fashionable Hakkasan Hanway Place in central London included a rather leggy Kelly Brook and a rather skinny Alexa Chung. Kelly, 33, showed no sign of 'comfort eating' as she looked ultra leggy in a thigh skimming black skirt and pretty padded detail cream blouse. Her hair was loose around her shoulders and she accessorised with a simple silver clutch bag. Feeling the cold: Alexa Chung went bare legged for the ceremony . Model looks: Jourdan Dunn is a British fashion model and she certainly looked the part as she arrived at Roc Nation . Alexa went bare legged as did model Jourdan Dunn who looked stunning in a full leather outfit with midriff baring top. Meanwhile Ben was the surprise winner of the night, taking home British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. Accepting the Breakthrough award – voted for by listeners of BBC Radio 1 - he humbly said: 'I'm not very good at speeches. I'm also not very good at dancing.' It was all about the legs: Jourdan looked amazing as she headed into the bash . Hey! Noel Gallagher greets his wife Sarah with a massive grin outside Hakkasan Hanway Place . Speaking at the Winner’s press conference a little later, he added: “I was a little shell shocked to win. This is definitely the cherry on the cake. 'The year had ended, the album had been so much more successful than we’d ever thought, to be nominated for the BRITs in the first place was amazing, and to actually come away with these two is… Bizarre, I think, is the best way to describe it.' One Direction debuted their new charity single ‘One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)’ at the show, and group lothario Harry Styles couldn’t escape a little fun being poked at him. Careful! Demi Lovato broke her leg at the beginning of the month so is using a cane to get around . Dashing: Tinie Tempah and Aston Merrygold opt for smart suits - although Tinie didn't bother with socks . Rita didn't bother with a coat: Alexa Chung covers up and Rita Ora reveals a lot of leg . A few too many..? Aston looks a bit bleary-eyed as he leaves the bash . Sharon Osbourne - who co-presented Best International Female – said: “Where is that little Harry wizard boy? Does he have his magic stick with him? That's his willy!' She then presented Lana Del Rey with the trophy, her second consecutive year of winning it. Speaking at the Winner’s press conference, she said: 'I do live here and I did write the record here, so it’s exciting to win. It’s the best thing I’ve been able to do in my life. I’ve talked to the people who have listened to the music and they’ve really been supportive and helped me.' Ready to party: Noel Gallagher arrived alone at the party . Will.i.am opts for colourful jeans and Simon Pegg looks rather dashing in black . Harry also had to suffer through watching his ex-girlfriend, Taylor Swift, perform ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ at the awards – a song widely believed to be about him. Capping off his night One Direction lost out in the Best British Group category to Mumford and Sons. Accepting their gong, lead singer Marcus Mumford said: 'Thank you very much indeed, we weren't really expecting that. “We haven't ever really taken the opportunity to thank everyone who comes to our gigs. I mean we're in a category with Muse and One Direction. We love being British and we love going round the world and spreading British music.' All was not lost however, and One Direction eventually triumphed, winning the special BRITs Global Success Award. Meanwhile more than more than 6.5 million viewers watched the BRIT Awards on ITV, the largest audience in a decade.\n"

            "By . Claudia Joseph . Lying undiscovered in a box in an attic for nearly 40 years, these are the unseen images of the Rolling Stones at a photo shoot for one of their most iconic albums. At the height of their fame in 1971, the band is captured chatting, laughing and occasionally Mick Jagger is even yawning nonchalantly as they pose for their Sticky Fingers album cover. The pictures, taken by photographer Peter Webb, show guitarist Mick Taylor in one of his first official appearances with Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman. Leaning Stones: Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Mick Jagger, Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor in one of the 1971 images . Jack Flash: Mick Jagger in a flatcap in the photoshoot that could have been used instead of the infamous zipper . In the end only a few images were ever released and the band eventually opted for their infamous and suggestive zipper cover, created by Andy Warhol and Craig Braun. However, the final colour image ‘Leaning Stones’ from the shoot was published and voted by Q Magazine as one of the top 100 rock ’n’ roll photographs of all time. A grainy black and white image entitled ‘The Big Yawn’ with Jagger standing to one side yawning while Wyman scratches his nose was printed on the inside sleeve of the album – their first of the 1970s and first to be released on their new label, Rolling Stones Records. For many critics it is the band’s best album. The collection of photographs was only discovered after Webb’s brother-in-law, Bill Pierce, also a photographer, found the negatives in a dust-covered box in his attic. ‘After they were found I walked around with this huge smile on my face for days,’ says Webb. ‘Who would have thought 40 years later the Rolling Stones would still be touring?’ Standing Stones: The band appear in relaxed mood for this shot taken at the height of their fame . Casual: Mick Jagger yawns and Bill Wyman picks his nose in a picture that was used for the record's inside sleeve . This is one of the many images that went unseen after the shoot which was commissioned for Sticky Fingers . Webb, a Cambridge graduate, learnt his trade in America as an assistant to photographer and film director Howard Zieff, whose films include Private Benjamin and My Girl. On his return to London he made his name as an advertising photographer and was spotted by David Puttnam, the filmmaker who at the time was working as a photographer’s agent. The future Lord Puttnam invited Webb to shoot his ‘friends’ the Rolling Stones for the cover of Sticky Fingers. After the band showed little interest in his original ideas, Webb decided to photograph them in a line up ‘like Dad’s Army’. He recalled: ‘I had been advised by a photographer friend that the band “were trouble” to photograph and they could end up throwing V-signs to the camera.’ Discovered: These shots of Keith Richards (right) and Mick Jagger (left) are just two of the many photographs unearthed from negatives in a dusty box in the attic of photographer Peter Webb . Uninterested? They showed 'little interest' in Webb's ideas until he suggested lining up 'like Dad's Army' But he found the band to be surprisingly well behaved. Webb said: ‘They were not only compliant to my instructions in arranging them, but even seemed somewhat camera shy, which was totally unexpected. ‘I had to ask them to act a little more threateningly, to which they duly obliged.’ He then took portraits of each band member, provoking Jagger to remark: ‘Passports is it now, mate?’ After the shoot, Webb went on to set up his own studio, directing the BAFTA-winning film Butch Minds the Baby and Give My Regards to Broad Street. But, caught up in the excitement of transforming his dark room into a cutting room, he forgot that he had handed his brother-in-law a folder of negatives to store. It was in 2009 that he got a telephone call from Pierce. He recalls his brother-in-law saying: ‘I’ve found an unmarked box of negatives in the attic. I think they’re your Rolling Stones pictures.’ The book Sticky Fingers: the Lost Session is available for £395 at www.snapgalleries.com. Orders before May 31 cost £265.\n"

            "A luxury Beverly Hills villa that was the scene of one of the Beatles most infamous parties has gone on sale - and appeared to have retained its psychedelic ambiance with some seriously retro decor. The mansion, built in 1949 in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, lists previous owners as Cary Grant and Zsa Zsa Gabor and can be yours for $3.1 million. The Beatles rented the 4,330 square-foot, Spanish-style house from actress Gabor in 1965 while on their North American Tour for some much-needed privacy and rest. However after inviting celebrity friends to their hideaway, the band took LSD, embarking on a two-day trip that inspired Lennon and McCartney to write song She Said, She Said. Scroll down for video . A long way from Liverpool: The LA mansion, which is on the market for $3.1million, was rented by The Beatles in 1965 . Acid experiment: The plush surroundings of the villa in the Benedict Canyon was where The Beatles threw LSD parties in the Sixties . A day in the life: The luxurious home was owned by actress Zsa Zsa Gabor when the Beatles rented it but also belonged to Cary Grant at one time . Fab life: The Beatles holed up at the mansion for a week, inviting celebrity friends Peter Fonda, Joan Baez and the Byrds to party with them . With four bedrooms, six bathrooms, two wet bars, a wine cellar, hardwood floors, five fireplaces, six car garage, pool - and 2.53 acres - there is plenty of room for rock and roll excess. The decor - heavily-patterned couches, wooden panels and a faux French chateau vibe - appeared to have had little done to it since the Fab Four paid a visit. Realtor Roger Perry told MailOnline that the home was put on the market on August 23 by current owner Pamela Juhos. The mansion was rented in late August 1965 by the band's manager Brian Epstein to give them a break from touring. The address of 2850 Benedict Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills spread like wildfire among fans and was besieged by devoted followers who blocked roads and tried to climb the steep canyon to reach their idols. Finding themselves trapped behind the property walls, The Beatles invited famous friends to join them including Eleanor Bron (who co-starred in Help!), Peggy Lipton and folk singer Joan Baez.. Psychedelic: The Beatles experimented with LSD before the release of the 1966 album Revolver . Secluded: The compound in Beverly Hills was besieged by Beatles' fans in 1965 keeping the Fab Four trapped inside . Fellow musicians the Byrds and actor Peter Fonda also stopped by, leading to the moment the  Beatles - minus Paul McCartney - took LSD. Genius: The Beatles 1966 album Revolver . The song She Said, She Said was later described by Lennon as an 'acidy song'. It has been suggested that he was inspired by comments Fonda made while the band and their guests were sitting in a huge empty bathtub in the master bedroom, high on hallucinogenics. She Said She Said features on the 1966 Revolver album - added by the band because they were a track short. Ringo Starr said of the album's recording: 'We . were having more fun in the studio, from Revolver Rubber Soul as it was . building up, it was getting more experimental, the songs were getting . better, more interesting. 'So that’s where we were going.' Revolver entered the British and U.S. charts at number one, staying there for seven and six weeks respectively. Expanding horizons: The Beatles invited fellow musicians and actors including Easy Rider star Peter Fonda to their rental home in the Californian hills . Hidden: The Beatles had achieved global fame by 1965 and that year's North American tour included dates at the Hollywood Bowl. The villa was supposed to allow the Fab Four privacy... but fans found them . Inspiration: John Lennon said that Peter Fonda's comments while on an acid trip at the house led to the lyrics for She Said She Said . Vivid: The band were trapped in the mansion after fans found out the address and besieged the property . The band's seventh studio album is considered one of their greatest musical achievements and regularly is included in lists of the best albums of all time. When asked about the influence of drug-taking on their music, John Lennon told an interviewer in 1972: 'They don't make you write any better. I never wrote any better stuff because I was on acid or not on acid.' The property is listed on Hauteliving.com, a cluster of some of the most opulent homes on the market around the world. Rest and relaxation: The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein rented the home from Zsa Zsa Gabor so the band could take a break on their North American tour . Band on the run: The Beatles tried to hide at the property but their devoted fans tried to scale the canyon behind the property to reach them .\n"

            "Stuart Pearce doesn't need me to defend him, but I'm not writing this specifically for him. Some people have a grudge against others because of events in the past. Clearly when Danny Mills launched his verbal assault on under-pressure Pearce before the derby at Derby there was more to it than a well-thought-out football observation. Pearce revealed all after his Forest side beat Derby. He'd dropped Mills when manager at Manchester City – hence the revenge. Stuart Pearce was under  pressure after a poor run of results that had seen them slip to 13th in the table . Pearce celebrates as Britt Assombalonga equalises for Nottingham Forest in the second half . Pearce celebrates wildly after Ben Osborn's late winning goal as Forest beat rivals Derby County 2-1 . Stuart Pearce isn't the only person who didn't rate Danny Mills, believe me. I've always judged Pearce on the football: as a player, he was everything a fan, a manager and a team-mate would want: passionate, talented and ready to go to war for his colleagues and friends. Before last summer I'd interviewed Pearce but never met him properly. He worked with us for talkSPORT out in Brazil at the World Cup. I'd heard that he didn't suffer fools gladly, so I was behind the eight ball form the start. Danny Mills said Nottingham Forest manager Pearce is 'not a great coach' and 'not a great tactician' Mills claims people say 'wow, it's Stuart Pearce, legend' but players quickly suss out the former left back . On his first evening we finished work and a group of us went out for a meal. I'd said a lot of things on air about Pearce and I wanted to tackle him off air. To my delight he was right up for it, so after a brief bit of small-talk about our shared love of The Stranglers (he thinks Rattus is the best album, I'm more of a Black and White fan myself), we launched into it head-on. Why did you think putting David James up front when Manchester City needed a goal was a good idea? Is your football too route one? Why did so many players pull out of your Under 21 squads? I was on a roll, but so was Pearce, and as pizza went cold we batted our views back and forth. It was one of my most enjoyable evenings of a brilliant and memorable trip. Goalkeeper David James came on as a forward during a Manchester City match in 2005 . Manchester City goalkeeper James was used as a forward in the final minutes against Middlesbrough . I think he was surprised that someone had actually had the bottle to say these things to his face – so many have written them, and conveniently forgotten them when confronted with Pearce himself. His mistrust of the press came up early during the conversation in the pizzeria. Overall I got some decent answers to my questions and he passionately defended himself as you'd expect. And I think he was pleased to get the chance to state his case. We agreed to disagree on many issues. Pearce then travelled around Brazil for a few days commentating on games for talkSPORT while I was based at the Maracana and the Copacabana. Pearce and Adrian Durham chat in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup for talkSPORT . On his return I was intrigued to see how he would react after our verbal sparring. The ice was broken after I caught him singing 'The Magnificent Seven' by The Clash. It's one of those songs where I know all the words as well, another shared musical love of ours. Pearce then sat down and gave me an interview of which I am very proud. It was in response to yet another England failure at a World Cup and listeners later told me they hung on his every word, even if they didn't agree with all of them. That might have been part of his job, so the true test was when I turned up at a Forest game this season. I wasn't expecting Pearce to join me for a post-match interview up in the press box – he was certainly under no obligation to make the trip up to the back of the stand. But he did, and it was good to see him again. Pearce joined Durham for a post-match interview in the press box aftrer a Nottingham Forest match . We're not best buddies or anything as unprofessional and cosy as that. And I still think he's got a lot to prove as a manager. But he's without doubt a man of integrity, and an honest, passionate guy. He doesn't need or deserve individuals with a grudge blasting him. If he fails, it should be because of things he gets wrong rather than something  Mills has held against him for years. I do like Pearce and I hope he takes Forest back to the Premier League. But I'm still not having David James up front. Pearce doesn't need defending as, if he fails, it should be for football reasons and not for a grudge . Pearce is 'not a great coach, not a great tactician and not a great motivator', according to Mills .\n"

He'll be there: Chris Martin's Coldplay will once again compete for a BRIT Award after being nominated for Best British Group . Meanwhile, nominee FKA Twigs, who has seen her popularity soar over the past year, wore a typically outlandish outfit a as she arrived to perform at the nominations announcement.

Also on hand to see the nominations announced were MTV's Laura Whitmore and nominees Jessie Ware and Jess Glynne. Back in December, newcomer James May was announced as the 2015 BRITs Critics' Choice Award winner, following in Sam Smith's footprints from last year.

'I'm pretty speechless,' James enthused. 'After all the years I've spent watching the BRITs and even after this year; watching my fan base grow so much, I never ‎thought I'd actually be getting an award myself. 'And what a huge honour to be following the incredible artists who've won before! I'm really chuffed, thank you to everyone who has supported me. Future star: James Bay was crowned the winner of the 2015 BRITs Critics' Choice Award back in December and got his hand on his prize at The BRITs Are Coming nominations show . Dressed to impress: The Saturdays star Rochelle Humes hit the red carpet in a sensational cut-out black jumpsuit . Hot mama: The mother-of-one looked simply sensational in her revealing jumpsuit . The BRIT Awards with MasterCard also revealed that George The Poet and Years & Years are the runners up. And he is set to be presented with the Critics' Choice Award at The BRITs Are Coming nominations show this evening. The show, hosted by dynamic duo Ant and Dec, will feature performances from James, as well as Clean Bandit and FKA Twigs. Getting in on the action: MTV's Laura Whitmore and British Female Solo Artist Jessie Ware showed up to hear the announcement . New look: This year's BRIT award has been designed by artist Tracey Emin . The young singer has big boots to fill since the past winners of the prize, which was only established in 2008, have all become huge international stars. James can now count himself on a par with Adele, Florence and the Machine, Ellie Goulding, Jessie J, Emeli Sandé, Tom Odell and Sam Smith. The BRITs Critics' Choice Award winners are chosen by a panel of music industry experts and key media tastemakers from among a list of over 100 candidates.

Celebrate:  Jess Glynne found her name on the shortlists three times as a guest vocalist on singles by Route 94 and Clean Bandit . Up and coming: British drum and bass duo Sigma, consisting of Cameron Edwards and Joe Lenzie, also attended . Meanwhile, the BRIT Awards are taking place on Wednesday 25 February at The O2 and award-winning artist Tracy Emin has designed this year's statue. Explaining how she put her own twist on the iconic trophy, Tracy said: 'You want to do it really well. You don't just want to decorate it, you want to make something that is really Tracey-ish, that is special for the people receiving it.' The star has become the fifth British artist to create her own design since the concept was established in 2011.

            "This is the moment Pharrell Williams and his backing dancers made a 'hands up' gesture in the middle of their Grammy performance. The artist took to the stage to perform his track Happy during music's biggest awards ceremony.

            "Actor Zach Braff has apologized after a tweet he sent on Sunday night comparing Pharrell’s bellboy outfit at the Grammys to the flying monkey in The Wizard of Oz got him into trouble . Scrubs actor Zach Braff has apologized after a tweet he sent on Sunday night comparing Pharrell’s bellboy outfit at the Grammys to the flying monkey in The Wizard of Oz got him into trouble. For the performance of his award-winning song Happy, singer/producer Pharrell wore a bellboy-type hat and jacket that provoked much online debate. While many viewers tweeted about Pharrell’s likeness to the bellhop in the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel, others wondered if – given his political-charged performance – the outfit was a reference to black bellhops. Braff joined the online debate when he jokingly shared a side-by-side picture of Pharrell and the flying monkey from the 2013 The Wizard of Oz-remake – Oz The Great and Powerful. 'Grammys are time-delayed in LA (?!) but someone just sent me this: #IWoreItBetter,’ he tweeted. His post sparked much intense debate online and he was called out for not realizing that comparing African Americans to monkeys could be construed as an offensive racial slur. On Monday Braff posted an apology, claiming that his reference was inspired by his voiceover role as a monkey in Oz. 'I love Pharrell. I thought the outfit he wore was similar to that of my bell hop in Oz. I apologize,’ he tweeted. Braff's post sparked much intense debate online and he was called out for not realizing that comparing African Americans to monkeys could be construed as an offensive racial slur . Pharrell took home two Grammys - Best Solo Performance and Best Video - for his song Happy on the night. His performance during the award show also provoked a reaction as it included dancers in black hoodies who struck a 'hands up, don't shoot' pose - a reference to the slogan used by protesters after the Michael Brown shooting. The gesture is the same  that has recently been used by demonstrators protesting the death of other unarmed black men at the hands of police - including Eric Garner in New York City. The use of hoods was a reference to the death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012.

            "After the 35th annual BRIT Awards came to a chaotic end on Wednesday night there was one thing that had everyone talking. It wasn't a showstopping dress on the red carpet or a drunken slurred speech - it was the moment 56-year-old Madonna took a tumble backwards mid-performance. After failing to undo her Armani cloak, which she has since said was tied too tightly, Madonna fell down a set of stairs landing in a crumpled heap on the floor. Scroll down for video . Madonna took a tumble at the BRIT Awards last night, the 56-year-old's fall was one of the most awkward moments in the award show's history . And although the singer pulled herself back up again and carried on her performance of Living For Love which ironically includes the line, 'Took me to heaven and let me fall down,' it was all anyone could talk about. That, and Kanye West. The 37-year-old rapper was roped in to perform at the awards show last minute after Rihanna reportedly didn't show up for rehearsals on Monday. However, he left a stunned audience opened-mouthed as he blasted out his new single All Day, which is includes the N-word said repeatedly. And despite ITV's attempts to censor him, the word was heard three times on television, with many viewers taking to Twitter in droves to complain. But Kanye and Madonna aren't the only people to have caused controversy at the infamously boozy awards show. Kanye's performance came under fire as he continuously used the N-word forcing ITV to mute his performance . Who can forget the time that Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage as Michael Jackson performed his hit song Earth Song in 1996. The Pulp frontman pranced around in front of the late singer and eventually was chased off by one of his backing dancers. There was also that time when Sharon Osbourne called comedian Vic Reeves a p***** b****** after he appeared to be drunk while  presenting an award in 2008. From Alex Turner's rambling acceptance speech in 2014 to Chumbawamba throwing a jug of water over John Prescott in 1998, Femail looks back over the most awkward, and controversial, BRITs moments ever... Last year Alex Turner gave an incredibly rambling acceptance speech seemingly slagging off the very industry that was honoring him . 2014: Alex Turner's Awards Speech . In 2014 the awkward BRIT Awards moment happened when Arctic Monkey's frontman Alex Turner gave an acceptance speech on behalf of the band for their Best British Group award. A rambling Turner lambasted the British music industry and claimed that rock 'n' roll wouldn't go away. He said: 'It will never die. And there's nothing you can do about it.' The speech was met with mass criticism as he seemed to be berating the very people who had given the band the accolade. The singer then ended his rambling message by dropping his microphone on the floor and walking off, leaving the audience stunned. In the same year Harry Styles caused laughs throughout the event when he left his bandmates hanging around on stage as they collected their Global Success award. The One Direction singer nearly missed his big moment because he was in the toilet. Running on stage in the nick of time he said: 'I'm really sorry I was having a wee, the toilets are ages away.' As James Cordon came up behind Adele, interrupting her acceptance speech she swore at the cameras live on television . 2012: Adele Vs The Suits . If there was one thing that didn't go down well at the BRIT Awards in 2012 it was when James Cordon interrupted Adele as she gave her acceptance speech for Album Of The Year. In a rush to introduce Blur and apparently spurred on by the show's producers James came on stage as Adele was making her thank yous and said, 'I'm so sorry, can I just cut off?' The singer responded by asked the TV presenter to clarify what he was saying and when he conceded that she needed to end her speech, she stuck her middle finger up to the camera live on television. Adele later said that she had been offended by the 'suits,' who had stopped her making her full acceptance speech and that she hoped she hadn't offended her fans. In 2010 Liam Gallagher not only snubbed his own brother when accepting the award for the 'Best Album of 30 Years'  missing Noel out of his acceptance speech . 2010: Liam Gallagher didn't want his award and threw his microphone into the audience . Given his history of feuds, punch ups and all round bad behavior it's little wonder than Liam Gallagher has enjoyed a controversial BRIT moment. In 2010 when he was awarded  a special 'Best Album of 30 Years,' award for (What's the story?) Morning Glory' not only did snub his own brother and bandmate, Noel, in his acceptance speech he went on to ramble for a full ten minutes. Then, when he'd finally finished, Gallagher threw not only his microphone but his actual award into the audience. It was reported that BRIT officials had to bargain with a fan to retrieve the statue and it meant the whole of the rest of the evening was delayed. When the Osbournes presented they were characteristically sweary and Vic Reeves ended up being offended by Sharon . 2008: The Osbournes got sweary and The Artic Monkeys dressed as farmers . When the Osbourne family were asked to present the awards in 2008 they clearly didn't get the 'no swearing on live television' memo. Not only did they fill the whole show with expletives, Sharon got particularly angry about comedian Vic Reeves. When he came on stage to present an the Best Album award Sharon deemed him too drunk to do the job after he stumbled over his words. She said to him: 'You’re p*****. P*** off you b******!' The Arctic Monkey's speech had to be cut from ITV's broadcast after they began to slag off the Brit school . Vic later said that it he had got confused over the autocue and felt offended by what Sharon had said. Keeping the controversy flowing the Arctic Monkey's who won the award  that Vic was presenting came on stage and promptly began to slag off the BRIT school. The band had attended the school from which the awards take their name, but Alex Turner proceeded to reveal that they hadn't had a very good time there. So bad was his speech that the producers of the show were forced to cut it short and not air it on the show. Whilst accepting his award for the Best Song in 2000 Robbie decided to challenge Liam Gallagher to a fight . 2000: Robbie Williams called for a fight and DJ Brandon Block thought he'd won an award . At the 2000 BRIT Awards Robbie Williams decided to use his moment of air time to challenge Oasis front man Liam Gallagher to a fight. There had long been an issue between the two of them after Liam had called Robbie the, 'fat dancer from Take That.' An inebriated-seeming Robbie took to the stage whilst accepting his best British Song award and said to the audience: 'So, anybody like to see me fight Liam? Would you pay to come and see it? 'Liam, a hundred grand of your money and a hundred grand of my money. We'll get in a ring and we'll have a fight and you can all watch it on TV.' Brandon stormed on stage thinking he had won an award and ended up with Ronnie Wood's drink in his face . Unfortunately despite Robbie's bravado and willingness to fight Liam, the event never ended up taking place. Robbie's speech wasn't the only awkward moment of the night. As Ronnie Wood was presenting the 'Best Soundtrack' award DJ Brandon Block's friends joked to him that he had won. Unfortunately Block was so drunk at the time that he believed them stumbling on stage to collect his honour. When he was challenged by Ronnie, who called him a c***, Brandon tried to get into a fight with the Rolling Stones drummer and eventually ended up with his drink in his face. Chumbawumba performed at the BRITs in 1998 and later the lead singer Danbert Nobacon chucked a bucket of ice cold water over John Prescott . 1998: Chumbawumba gave  John Prescott a soaking . Two very odd things happened at the BRIT Awards in 1998. Firstly John Prescott was invited to the awards. Secondly, while he was happily sitting at his table he ended up having a bucket of water thrown over his head by lead singer of the band Chumbawumba, Danbert Nobacon. Danbert showed no regret at his actions and said: 'If John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the BRIT Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him.' John Prescott looked pretty unimpressed after having a bucket of ice cold water thrown over him when he attended the BRIT Awards in 1998 . It was during this Michael Jackson performance at the BRIT Awards in 1996 that Jarvis Cocker jumped on stage and mooned the audience . 1996: Jarvis Cocker mooned Michael Jackson . Perhaps one of the most infamous moments in BRITs history was when Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage during Michael Jackson's performance of Earth Song in 1996. Jarvis, the Pulp singer, took to the stage and ran around bending over and showing his bottom to the world as the late singer performed. Jarvis was pictured after the event swigging Champagne from the bottle - he later revealed he wasn't happy with the fact that Michael had been trying to play god . Jarvis later said that he acted the way he did because he couldn't handle the fact that Michael was pretending to be Jesus. He said: 'He was pretending to be Jesus - I'm not religious but I think, as a performer myself, the idea of someone pretending to have the power of healing is just not right. 'Rock stars have big enough egos without pretending to be Jesus - that was what got my goat, that one particular thing.' When Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood presented the awards in 1989 it was a total disaster, the pair kept on messing up the autocue and fluffing their lines . 1989: The Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood co-presenting disaster . In 1989 the show's producers made an attempt to revamp the BRITs bringing in the odd combination of the Page 3 model Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac to present. The twosome had a disastrous show. Guests came on at the wrong time, they fluffed their lines and they had a pre-recorded Michael Jackson speech which they forgot to air altogether.\n"

            "Los Angeles (CNN) -- If you are parked in front of your TV to watch the Grammys, you only saw a fraction of what happened at the annual music awards show Sunday. In fact, 70 of the 81 trophies were handed out in a pre-telecast ceremony in the Nokia Theatre L.A. LIVE, next to the Staples Center where the last 11 Grammys were presented between a record 20 star-studded performances. Plenty of action takes place backstage where the winners go to talk after they leave the stage, as well. There were hints backstage that the Zac Brown Band, which claimed the best country album Grammy, may be veering into other music genres. \"I love great music of all different kinds,\" Zac Brown said. \"We're just getting started. One project ahead is an acoustic album, Brown said. \"We really control all of our destiny now and all of our rights to everything we do now, so we can really experiment,\" he said.

Paul McCartney was a no-show to pick up his Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album. It was awarded for his \"Kisses on the Bottom\" album.

Brown used the Grammy weekend to develop relationships with other artists. \"My rolodex got strong this weekend,\" He said. After Carrie Underwood won her sixth Grammy, the latest for best country solo performance, she made it clear backstage that she's sticking to country music and would never cross over into pop music. \"I love that world,\" Underwood said. \"I love the people in it. I love making country music that anybody can get into. If it ever crosses over, then it does it on its on. I don't think I can see myself making a pop album.\" We learned backstage why Jay-Z teased The Dream about the \"Boyz in the Hood\" he was wearing when they accepted their Grammy for best rap/sung collabotation. \"I would like to thank the swap meet for his hat,\" Jay-Z said in his acceptance. \"He was just\n",
